<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the fifteenth
century, England experienced, in a lamentable degree, the sad
effects of internal discord, and the miseries caused by the
conflicts of adverse factions.</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible, for historians to point out, in the
annals of any country in Europe, in the feudal ages, deeds of
violence and bloodshed, of a more appalling nature, than those
which the chroniclers have recorded, as having occurred in
England, during the period which intervened between the years
1400 and 1500&mdash;a period memorable for the sanguinary wars of
York and Lancaster.&nbsp; During the continuance of those
disastrous conflicts, thousands of brave men perished in arms,
the axe of the executioner was seldom idle, great numbers of the
nobility and gentry lost their lives in the field or upon the
scaffold, property was usurped in consequence of wholesale
confiscations, numberless innocent lives were sacrificed, and
many happy homes were outraged.</p>
<p>This misery was the result of contests for a crown, which
perhaps neither of the claimants merited, nor does it appear,
that it was of great importance to the nation, which of the rival
competitors wore it.</p>
<p>Of those destructive wars, the battle of Shrewsbury in the
reign of Henry IV., in 1403, may be considered in some degree as
the first; because it was the earliest attempt by an appeal to
arms, to remove from the throne a monarch of the House of
Lancaster; <a name="citationv"></a><a href="#footnotev"
class="citation">[v]</a> and the last was the battle of <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>Stoke, fought
in 1487, in the reign of Henry VII.; that of Bosworth, in which,
by the death of Richard III., the Plantagenet dynasty terminated,
being often erroneously called the last; but, although the latter
certainly placed the House of Tudor upon the throne, the crown
was secured to it by the battle of Stoke, when the partisans of
the House of York, under John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, made
their final but unsuccessful appeal to arms, in hopes of
regaining the ascendency, which that party had formerly
enjoyed.</p>
<p>These sanguinary conflicts are usually called the Wars of the
Roses, from the circumstance, that the supporters of the House of
York assumed the badge or device of the White Rose, and those of
Lancaster the Red Rose.</p>
<p>It has been remarked with great truth, by Sir John Fenn, the
antiquary, <a name="citationvi1"></a><a href="#footnotevi1"
class="citation">[vi1]</a> in adverting to that disastrous
period, &ldquo;That our own kingdom has fewer authentic records
of the transactions, during the reigns of Henry VI., Edward IV.,
and Richard III., than of any other later period of our history,
is a truth known to and lamented by every man of historical
knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ascribes the deficiency of information, amongst other
causes, to the invention of printing; which at first sight
appears to be a paradox, because such an invention seems to be
calculated to favour universal knowledge:&mdash;&ldquo;At the
beginning of the art of printing, those who practised it, were
solicitous to perpetuate things already committed to writing,
relative to past times, and past occurrences, not regarding
recent transactions as of equal consequence.&nbsp; This art
likewise probably prevented the writers of manuscripts from
multiplying their copies; they foreseeing that the new invention
would in time, supply a sufficient number, at a much less price,
by which means, the value of their manual labour would be greatly
diminished.&rdquo; <a name="citationvi2"></a><a
href="#footnotevi2" class="citation">[vi2]</a></p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>Notwithstanding, however, the scanty nature of the
historical accounts handed down to us, some information of value
has reached us; and the fields of battle, and the positions of
the hostile armies, may in several instances, be clearly
identified, after a perusal of the statements of the old
chroniclers, and a comparison of their descriptions with the
present aspect of the localities where the battles were
fought.</p>
<p>Having felt a considerable degree of interest in the
occurrences of those stirring and extraordinary times, I have
repeatedly visited the scenes of action; and, by carefully
comparing the statements of the old writers, the actual
appearance of the fields, and the traditions of the
neighbourhood, I have obtained strong confirmation, in several
instances, of the accuracy of the accounts which have been handed
down to us; and have derived great pleasure from visiting and
exploring the various localities, and obtaining information from
persons in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The results of my visits were committed to writing, in a
series of papers, <a name="citationvii"></a><a
href="#footnotevii" class="citation">[vii]</a> of which copies,
or the principal parts, will be found in the following
pages.&nbsp; Some historical matters will also be introduced, in
such instances as tend to elucidate any important event, which
immediately preceded or had a direct relation to any of the
battles.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted, that in the majority of historical
works, describing the events of this country in the fifteenth
century, whenever the exploits of any noblemen or warriors, <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>or the
talents or skill of any men of eminence, are mentioned, the
authors, from some cause or other, very rarely give any
information of much value relative to the individuals whose
actions they are describing; but as few readers can reflect upon
the surprising events of that period without feeling a
considerable degree of interest in the warlike and distinguished
personages, who were the principal actors in those stirring and
eventful times, there will be found in the notes to this work,
some explanatory and biographical particulars <a
name="citationviii"></a><a href="#footnoteviii"
class="citation">[viii]</a> of the princes, nobles, and eminent
persons, whose actions and conduct are noticed in it.</p>
<p>In the following publication will also be found some other
papers and tracts, principally of an arch&aelig;ological nature,
written at various times, as the subjects came under my notice;
and as they may possibly interest, in some degree, the class of
readers who take pleasure in pursuits of that description, I have
been induced to add them to the present collection.</p>
<p>In committing this work to the press, it will be a source of
gratification to the Author, if his humble exertions shall be, in
some degree, instrumental in elucidating any events hitherto
imperfectly known, in solving any difficulties which may have
suggested themselves, or in confirming the statements of the old
historical writers of this country.</p>

A gentleman almost forspent with speed,<br />
That stopp&rsquo;d by me to breathe his bloodied horse:<br />

And that you Harry Percy&rsquo;s spur was cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Henry IV.</i>

</blockquote>
<p>Twice in the year 1851, and once in each of the five
succeeding years, <a name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a> I visited the field of the celebrated
Battle of Shrewsbury, and also the church erected there by King
Henry the Fourth.&nbsp; It is called Battlefield Church, and owes
its erection to Henry&rsquo;s gratitude for, and desire to
commemorate, the victory which he obtained in 1403, over the
insurgent forces commanded by Henry Percy, usually called
Hotspur, the son of Henry Percy, the first Earl of Northumberland
<a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c"
class="citation">[1c]</a> <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of that surname, and by the
earl&rsquo;s brother, Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a></p>
<p>The field of battle has also occasionally been called the
Battle of Berwick Field, of Bull Field, and of Hussee Field: the
two former appellations being taken from the names of
neighbouring places, at or near which, Percy&rsquo;s army is said
to have been, prior to the battle; and the latter from an ancient
family owning the lands where the battle took place, <a
name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a> and it is now called Battlefield.</p>
<p>It lies about three miles and a quarter, in a north-westwardly
direction, from Shrewsbury, contiguous to the turnpike road, of
which one fork or continuation leads in one direction by Prees
and Whitchurch, towards Cheshire, and another towards <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span> Hodnet, and
Market Drayton.&nbsp; From that road there is also another road
which turns off to the eastward, towards Staffordshire.&nbsp;
Those circumstances may be material, with reference to
endeavouring to ascertain the line of march of the insurgent
forces when they advanced towards Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>In 1403, a confederacy was entered into between the Earl of
Northumberland, the Earl of Worcester, Henry Percy (called
Hotspur), Owen Glendowr, and others, for an insurrection <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> against Henry IV.&nbsp; In order to
prevent its being interfered with by incursions from the Scotch,
and probably also in order to have a valiant and useful
confederate, Archibald Earl Douglas, who had been taken prisoner
at the battle of Hallidown Hill in 1402, was liberated by Percy
on condition of his engaging to join in the enterprise, and was
allowed to go home, from whence he returned with a select party
of his own men.&nbsp; The Earl of Northumberland was unwell, and
remained at Berwick; but his son Henry Percy commenced his march
towards Cheshire, where he expected to be reinforced by the
gentlemen of that county, who had always been attached to the
memory of Richard II., and he was not disappointed in that
respect.&nbsp; Percy, with Earl Douglas and a great army,
departed out of the northern parts, leaving his (Percy&rsquo;s)
father sick, and came to Stafford, where his uncle the Earl of
Worcester and he met, <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a> and increased their
forces by all the means they could devise; from thence they
proceeded towards Wales, expecting there additional aid and
reinforcements. <a name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a></p>
<p>Not any of the old annalists or chroniclers give us
information as to the exact line of march, which Percy and his
forces pursued from the north into Shropshire.&nbsp; From the
circumstance of the confederates being stated to have issued a
proclamation, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>in which they asserted that Richard II. was alive at
Chester, <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> and invited his partisans to meet in
arms in that city; <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> and from the reinforcements which the
confederates obtained from Cheshire, it might perhaps be inferred
that they entered Staffordshire from Cheshire, by the Whitchurch
and Prees road; but on the other hand, if Percy marched, as we
are told he did, with his army to Stafford, and was there joined
by the Earl of Worcester <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a> and his forces, it
is tolerably clear that the insurgent army must have entered
Shropshire on its eastward side, in marching towards Shrewsbury;
and it has been suggested, with much appearance of probability,
that they entered the county through Newport, by High Ercall and
Haghmond Hill. <a name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a>&nbsp; In either case, it is certain
that they advanced to Shrewsbury, and arrived there some time on
the 19th of July, but too late to get possession of the town; and
in marching from the north (as the river encompasses the town
nearly on three sides), it is tolerably certain, that they
advanced in order to attack it at the north or Castle Gate.&nbsp;
Henry IV. had assembled an army against the Welsh, and was with
it at Burton-upon-Trent, when he heard of the confederates&rsquo;
hostile movements; and by the Earl of Dunbar&rsquo;s advice,
immediately marched towards Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He was at
Burton-upon-Trent on the 16th of July, <a
name="citation4d"></a><a href="#footnote4d"
class="citation">[4d]</a> and on the 17th at Lichfield, <a
name="citation4e"></a><a href="#footnote4e"
class="citation">[4e]</a> from whence he would probably take the
Watling Street Road, and after arriving at Shrewsbury, he would
naturally enter it over the Abbey Bridge. <a
name="citation4f"></a><a href="#footnote4f"
class="citation">[4f]</a>&nbsp; He succeeded in getting
possession of the town a few hours before Percy&rsquo;s arrival,
who is said to have reached the Castle Foregate on the evening of
July 19th.&nbsp; This judicious course was of the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>utmost
importance to the success of Henry&rsquo;s cause, as by it he
secured the passage of the Severn, and prevented Owen Glendowr,
who had advanced with his forces to Oswestry, from crossing the
river and effecting a junction with Percy.&nbsp; Henry had
scarcely entered Shrewsbury, when he was apprized by his scouts
that the confederate forces, with banners displayed, were
advancing towards him, and were so courageous and bold, that
their light cavalry had begun to skirmish with his troops; upon
which he marched out, and encamped without the east gate of the
town, <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> and offered battle to his enemies. <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a></p>
<p>Percy, who had prepared to have assaulted the town, being
baffled in his design by the King&rsquo;s movements, and probably
reluctant that the engagement should take place in the absence of
the Welsh forces, and whilst his enemies had superior numbers,
retired from before Shrewsbury as soon as he saw the royal
standard flying there. <a name="citation5c"></a><a
href="#footnote5c" class="citation">[5c]</a>&nbsp; As Henry had
much to hazard and nothing to gain by delay, it was clearly his
interest to fight; yet, being aware of the risk and chances of a
battle, he appears to have been desirous to avoid it, by
negotiations for peace.&nbsp; The Abbot of Shrewsbury went more
than once to the insurgents, in the hope of effecting a pacific
accommodation between the hostile parties.&nbsp; The habits and
usages of that age justified the mediation of a dignitary of the
Romish Church of so elevated a degree as the Abbot of Shrewsbury;
besides which, he had the King&rsquo;s sanction for interfering
as a mediator.&nbsp; But in a few years hence, it will scarcely
be credited, although it is now a notorious fact, that three
elderly persons from England, unauthorised by the British
Government, and belonging to a <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>respectable body of men, of which the
members are not usually wanting in shrewdness and intelligence,
were actually so absurd as to go out to St. Petersburg, in the
depth of winter (and let it not be forgotten, that it was a
Russian winter into the bargain), in January 1854, to try to talk
over the Emperor Nicholas, and to coax him from going to war with
the Turks and their allies.&nbsp; It is pretty certain, that
posterity will either not credit the fact of so ridiculous an
attempt having been made, by those three persons, or will
believe, that whether they were deficient in common sense or not,
at least they must have possessed a considerable degree of
self-estimation or presumption.</p>
<p>The negotiations and pacific exertions of the Abbot of
Shrewsbury, however, not terminating in a satisfactory result,
both parties prepared for a mortal conflict.&nbsp; Some small
reinforcements of Welsh forces, but probably not in considerable
numbers, contrived to effect a junction with the confederates;
and although now, when we are all happily united as one nation,
it may seem unnatural and strange to us, the presence of
Scotchmen and Welshmen fighting on Percy&rsquo;s side would in
that age necessarily kindle amongst the forces of Henry, feelings
of national antipathy, in addition to other feelings of hostility
towards the opposite army.</p>
<p>It is not an easy matter to understand, why it happened, that
the hostile armies came in collision, at such a spot as
Battlefield.&nbsp; The field did not offer any natural advantage
of position of moment, to Percy&rsquo;s army; whilst, if he had
retired a few miles further on the same line of road, he would
have come to some much stronger positions.&nbsp; But, as
Battlefield is on the road, through Hodnet and Market Drayton,
towards the North, it seems most probable, that, when he was
disappointed in his attempt upon Shrewsbury, he at first prepared
to retreat back to Northumberland, but found that after getting
so near to Henry, it was no longer practicable to effect a
retreat with safety in the face of a superior force.&nbsp; It was
too late, and no other course remained for him, but to turn at
bay and fight.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>The
battle was accordingly fought on the eve or vigil of St. Mary
Magdalen, Saturday, the 21st of July, 1403; <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> and the place where it was fought has
ever since been called Battlefield.</p>
<p>The two armies seem not to have been quite equal in
numbers.&nbsp; In consequence of Glendowr&rsquo;s forces not
joining Percy, the army of Henry is said to have been more
numerous than that of his enemies.</p>
<p>The battle commenced with a fierce discharge of arrows on each
side.&nbsp; Both armies behaved with great valour; and Percy,
Douglas, and others, in the heat of the battle, hoping to effect
the destruction of the King, valiantly forced their way into the
centre of his forces, but were baffled in their attempt by the
King&rsquo;s having withdrawn from his original position.&nbsp;
At one period, Henry&rsquo;s van was broken, his standard
overthrown; his son Henry Prince of Wales was wounded in the face
by an arrow, but continued fighting; Sir Walter Blount and three
other persons, armed in all respects like the King, were slain;
and the fortune of the day appeared to incline against the
King.&nbsp; Percy, who had charged furiously into the centre of
Henry&rsquo;s ranks, seemed in a fair way of gaining the
victory.&nbsp; Henry, however, who displayed the utmost valour,
and is said to have slain some of his enemies with his own hand,
and had been unhorsed at one period of the battle, brought up his
reserve at an important moment, which appears to have turned the
scale; and Percy was killed, according to one account, by a
spear, and <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>according to another, by an arrow which pierced his
brain.&nbsp; His death seems to have had a material effect in
deciding the victory in Henry&rsquo;s favour; the insurgent
forces, disheartened by that fatal event, gave way, and fled in
great disorder. <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; The battle lasted three
hours.&nbsp; On Henry&rsquo;s side, besides 3000 wounded, Edmund
Earl of Stafford, <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> who commanded the van, and the
following knights, Sir Hugh Shirley, Sir John Clifton, Sir John
Cockaine, Sir Nicholas Gausel, Sir Walter Blount, Sir John
Calverley, Sir John Massey of Pudington, Sir Hugh Mortimer, and
Sir Robert Gausel, all of whom had received the honour of
knighthood that morning, and about 1600 men, are said to have
fallen in the field of battle.&nbsp; On Percy&rsquo;s side, the
loss of those slain in fight or in pursuit is estimated at 5000;
and amongst the slain were 200 knights and gentlemen of Cheshire,
who had joined Percy.&nbsp; As for the Scotch, few or none
escaped alive.&nbsp; Sir Richard Venables (Baron of Kinderton),
and Sir Richard Vernon (Baron of Shipbrook), both of Cheshire,
and the Earl of Worcester, were taken prisoners, and beheaded two
days afterwards (on Monday) at the High Cross at Shrewsbury; and
the head of Worcester was set up over London Bridge.&nbsp; Henry
appears to have discouraged a very vindictive or eager pursuit
after the fugitives; and of those who escaped, many got back to
Northumberland, and shut themselves up in castles there: not
liking to trust the King&rsquo;s good faith. <a
name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a>&nbsp; Earl Douglas was taken, but was
sometime afterwards liberated.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In a
close or meadow on the right or north side of the present lane,
leading towards the church from the turnpike road, there is the
appearance of a slight bank and trench running parallel with that
lane, which possibly may have been part of an intrenchment made
in front of Percy&rsquo;s line.&nbsp; The close on the south side
of the lane is called the King&rsquo;s Croft, and it is
traditionally said that a portion of Henry&rsquo;s army was
posted there; the probability is, that its name at that period,
and before the present fences and enclosures were made, had a
much wider application, and that King&rsquo;s Croft extended on
both sides of the present lane.</p>
<p>In gratitude for, and in commemoration of, this victory, Henry
the Fourth erected on the spot, Battlefield Church; and from the
circumstance of the battle having been fought on St. Mary
Magdalen&rsquo;s eve, he, in compliance with the prevalent
opinions of the age, and probably also from his considering
himself in some degree indebted to her for the victory, caused
the church to be dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen.&nbsp; The church
is of the Gothic style, part Decorated, and part
Perpendicular.&nbsp; It is not of a large size, <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> but is handsome; and the edifice, with
its battlemented tower, forms an interesting object on the
westward side of the turnpike road, from which it is distant two
or three fields&rsquo; breadth.&nbsp; We cannot doubt that there
must have been some strong motive, for selecting for its erection
the spot where the church stands, for it is at an inconvenient
distance from the highway, in a peculiar and, at that time, a
lonely place, where there was not even a village near it, or a
carriage road running immediately past it.&nbsp; May we not
conclude, that the motive was, either that it was the spot where
the brunt of the battle took place; where the King escaped some
imminent danger; or where Percy was slain?</p>
<p>The country, though not quite flat, has merely a gentle ascent
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>from
Shrewsbury to Battlefield, and also to the northward of the
church, and along the turnpike road.&nbsp; Here, in a line almost
east and west, Percy&rsquo;s army was drawn up very near the
place where the church now stands, and in what are now the fields
to the northward of it; and the left wing of his army probably
also extended across the spot where the present turnpike road
runs.&nbsp; The army of Henry IV., after advancing from
Shrewsbury, took up its position opposite that of Percy.&nbsp;
Percy&rsquo;s forces, being posted as before mentioned, had the
advantage of ground, if there were any advantage in the very
slight ascent, which has been already noticed.&nbsp; Leland, in
adverting to the position selected by Percy, says, that he
&ldquo;having got the advantage of the ground,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a>&nbsp; I could not ascertain, after
making some inquiries in that neighbourhood, that any relics
indicative of the battle had very recently been dug up.&nbsp; I
however was informed, that human bones, fragments of armour,
spurs, and similar relics, had formerly been discovered there;
and Grose, the author of the <i>Military Antiquities</i>,
particularly mentions the discovery of a weapon there, which he
considered to be a bill, and of which he has given an engraving,
but which Meyrick, in his work on Ancient Armour (which is a work
of high authority in such matters), states to be a gisarme; <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> and one man informed me that in his
time, human bones had been found there in ploughing.&nbsp; I am
indebted to the politeness of the incumbent of the church, the
late Rev. J. O. Hopkins, rector of Uffington, for the
information, that in the field near the church, spurs, fragments
of armour, of weapons, &amp;c., have been dug up, but in small
quantities; and it seems remarkable, that the relics discovered
there have been comparatively few; although, as the battle was
fought in the heat of summer, the slain must necessarily have
been promptly interred, and the opportunity for carefully
stripping them, and carrying off various articles from <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the field,
must have been diminished. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Many of the
slain were interred on the spot upon which the church was
afterwards erected; <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a> and the Rev. J. O.
Hopkins informed me, that some years ago, a drain was dug to
carry off the wet from the Corbet vault, which is enclosed with
iron railing, as shown in the engraving, <a
name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> in the small close or field lying on
the north side of the chancel; and in digging deep, the workmen
cut through large masses of human bones.&nbsp; There cannot be
any doubt, from the description of the spot, that vast numbers of
the slain were interred there, in a large trench or pit. <a

<p>It is exceedingly probable, that if a search were made by
digging in other fields and meadows in the neighbourhood of
Battlefield Church, it would be ascertained that numbers of the
slain were buried in them. <a name="citation11e"></a><a
href="#footnote11e" class="citation">[11e]</a>&nbsp; Many persons
of note who perished in the battle, were interred at the

class="citation">[11f]</a></p>
<p>The church is a handsome ecclesiastical edifice.&nbsp; The
nave or body is now roofless and dilapidated; and, from its
moss-grown and impaired appearance, must have been a ruin for a
long period.&nbsp; It is said that the nave of the church
suffered during the rule of the Parliament or of Cromwell.&nbsp;
Its exterior walls, the mullions, and most of the tracery work
(which is undoubtedly handsome) of its windows, are, however,
still existing.&nbsp; The nave is entered by a door in the
original pointed <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>arched doorway, on the north side; and its floor has
long been used as a graveyard, or place of interment. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>A corresponding doorway is on its south side, the door of
which is now seldom used, except on the occasion of
funerals.&nbsp; There are on each side of the nave, three large
handsome windows; and there has been a fourth window, now built
up on each side of the nave, between the doorway and the tower;
and, although seemingly made at the same period, some of them are
of the Decorated and some of the Perpendicular style; and the two
windows which immediately adjoin the chancel on the north and
south sides, differ in some respects from the others, as some of
the windows have the dripstones terminating at the bottom with
plain returns, whilst others have them terminating in
representations <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>of human heads.&nbsp; There are some indications of a
porch having been at the south door.&nbsp; Several grotesque
corbel-heads are carved in stone in the chancel, in the places
from which the arches of the roof have originally sprung; and the
remains of some strange figures or monsters appear carved on the
outsides, at the places on the wall, where the spouts of the roof
seem to have formerly protruded, similar to those called
gurgoyles, which may be seen on many other ancient churches.</p>
<p>The exterior of the church between the windows is supported by
handsome stone buttresses, and from the indisputable marks of the
ancient roof, which are visible on the east side of the tower,
where the roof has joined up to it, and from there not being any
traces of columns supporting any interior arches, it seems clear
that it has never had any clerestory.</p>
<p>Exterior buttresses are built at the corners of the tower, and
a square projection on its south-east corner admits of a
staircase.&nbsp; The tower is said to have been erected in 1504;
and its walls, and most of its pinnacles, are still
perfect.&nbsp; It had originally eight pinnacles, but one on the
east side fell down about 1851. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a> The tower can be
ascended by a spiral staircase <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a> to the top; but
its roof is in a decayed condition, its floors are quite gone;
and on the basement floor are placed various mutilated stone
fragments, apparently of mullions, transoms, finials, and other
parts of stonework, which have fallen or have been deposited
there, besides part of the ancient font.&nbsp; It still has,
however, a bell, which is yet used.&nbsp; Each side of the tower
is surmounted by an embattled parapet of equal intervals, with
plain cappings, and which, though not possessing the lightness of
one with pierced battlements, is nevertheless handsome.&nbsp; The
tower at the highest part, and just below the battlements, has a
handsome carved Gothic border, enriched (as far as my eyesight
enabled me to form a judgment) with diamond-shaped ornaments <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and
quatrefoils.&nbsp; On the west it has two windows; and over the
highest, in the middle of the border, is a small escutcheon
bearing an animal, seemingly a lion rampant passant, probably
intended for the arms of the Hussee family, and which also
appears in a corresponding place on the south side, and there are
also some indications of it on the north side.&nbsp; On the east,
in the centre of the border, is a small escutcheon, containing
some appearances of an inscription.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the tower from falling, of which it
exhibited symptoms, iron bars, with nuts and screws, have been
fixed across it, so as to hold its walls together; two of the
nuts are on its east side, as shown in the engraving. <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>The tower has one window on the east, one on the north, and
one on the south side; and it has had a door with a pointed arch
on the west, which is now built up.&nbsp; The second floor is
singularly furnished with a fireplace, having a chimney formed
within the thickness of the wall, and opening outside of the
western window of the bell-chamber.</p>
<p>The chancel is used for divine service on the Lord&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; It is separated from the ruinous nave by a
comparatively modern wall.&nbsp; In a vault on the north side of
the chancel, is the place of interment of the family of Andrew
William Corbet, Esq., of Pimley and Sundorne.&nbsp; A handsome
monument to the memory of John Corbet, Esq., is erected in the
chancel on its north side, behind which is the arch of a doorway
visible from the exterior, now built up, but which has evidently
been formerly an entrance into the chancel.&nbsp; A railed
enclosure adjoining it, shown in the engraving, <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> contains the entrance to the vault of
the Corbets.&nbsp; On its south side, not far from the altar, are
three sedilia, with plain Gothic arches; and the one furthest
from the altar is in a great degree filled with a much mutilated
and whitewashed oaken image of the Virgin Mary <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> with a figure in her lap, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>representing
the dead Christ, which seems as if it had been brought there from
some other part of the church.&nbsp; Mutilated as the figure of
the Virgin now is, there still remains an expression of sorrow in
the face.</p>
<p>A large plain piscina is in the wall between the sedilia and
the altar, but partly concealed by the wooden back of a seat.</p>
<p>The east or altar window is handsome, and of the Perpendicular
Gothic style, and is of five lights below, with a transom; and
the handsome tracery of the upper part, will be best understood
by a reference to the engraving, which gives a correct view of
the east end, and part of the north side of the church.&nbsp; The
window has some stained glass, much injured and dilapidated,
which contains, amongst other designs, two crowned heads, a male
and a female, seemingly of considerable antiquity, but well
executed by the artist; and close to them, a human head in a
dish, near to which the point of the blade of a scimitar appears,
and which are said, and as I believe with truth, to represent the
head of John the Baptist brought to Herod and Herodias.&nbsp;
Some imperfect escutcheons of arms, with various quarterings, are
also there.&nbsp; The stained glass also contains representations
of the patera, cup, and wafer; and underneath is a faint
representation of the crucifixion; and in another place in the
window, a hammer and a nail are exhibited, apparently in allusion
to the crucifixion.&nbsp; Underneath is part of a mutilated
inscription in old English characters, commencing with the words,
&ldquo;Orate pro animabus Rogeri.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also contains a
monogram, which seems to be a combination of the letters in the
name &ldquo;Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the stonework on the outside, immediately before the east
or altar window, is a niche surmounted by a Gothic canopy, in
which still stands, although a good deal impaired by time or <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>violence, the
statue of Henry IV., about half the size of life, in armour, with
the remains of a crown on his head, and a dagger hanging on his
right side; his right hand once sustained a sword, but it is now
gone.</p>
<p>There are two windows on each side of the chancel, of which
the mullions and general appearance bear a resemblance, though
not quite the same, to those of the nave, and might be thought to
be of a more modern date, if the whole of the fabric and the
appearance of the stonework did not strongly convey the
impression of all having been erected at the same date; in fact
the style and appearance of the church, are just what might be
expected in one erected early in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>In the chancel is a handsome large modern stone font, with
ornaments in the Gothic style, which supplies the place of the
ancient one, of which some stonework lying within the tower,
formed part.&nbsp; There is a small cemetery still in use for
interments on the south side of the church.</p>
<p>On each side of the exterior of the chancel, and nearest the
east end, are dripstones, as if intended for the arch of a
window, carried up nearly but not quite to a point, and with the
stones ready jointed, as if for the purpose of breaking out an
additional window on each side of the chancel, without disturbing
the walls; but I think it is quite evident, from the appearance
of the stonework, and from the dripstones for the contemplated
windows or arches not having been carried up to meet at the top,
that no window ever existed in either of those places; and that
the intention of so singular a preparation by the architect, may
have been, to add at some future time, side chapels, such as are
often seen in ancient churches, and are known to have been added
subsequently to the erection of the churches.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the chancel is modern, and is plastered and
whitewashed, and supported by modern incongruous-looking
pillars.</p>
<p>The church is approached by a narrow carriage way, which leads
from the westward side of the turnpike road; but it <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>stops at a
gate opening into a field, in which the church stands, and a
short path leads to it from the gate.</p>
<p>There is one remarkable singularity connected with the church,
which is, that there is every appearance of the church, and the
college after mentioned, having stood in a square space enclosed
by a moat.&nbsp; A moat regularly formed, and as straight as a
canal, exists at a short distance from the east end of the
church, except at one small spot near the centre, which appears
to have been filled up, in order to admit of the path to the
church; and it turns with an abrupt angle at each end, and
extends a considerable distance on the north and south sides of
the church.&nbsp; I was unable, however, to trace its existence
on the west side, or to discover whether it had ever completely
encompassed the church.</p>
<p>Besides the erection of the church, there was erected there by
Henry IV., or by Roger Ive, clerk, by virtue of a charter or
license from Henry, a small college, consisting of a principal or
master, and five secular chaplains, together with a hospital for
several poor persons, of which Henry IV. was a benefactor. <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>The charter or license was of the eleventh year of the reign
of Henry IV., and the first principal or master was the said
Roger Ive. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>A copy of an impression of the seal of the college, is given
in Dukes&rsquo; <i>Antiquities of Shropshire</i>, <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> which exhibits on it, not as might be
expected, the effigy of St. Mary Magdalen, but that of the Virgin
Mary crowned, bearing the infant Jesus on her right arm, and a
palm branch in her left hand.</p>
<p>At the time of the dissolution, the yearly revenues amounted
to &pound;54. 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> net.&nbsp; Not a vestige now
remains of the college.</p>
<p>There are several shallow holes or pits in the meadow on the
south side of the church, which have been dug into, in hopes of
discovering something of interest; but nothing remarkable was <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>discovered.&nbsp; It has been conjectured that they are
the sites of small fishponds, which may have existed before the
college was destroyed; but they appeared to me more like the
excavations, where the foundations or cellars of the old college
buildings may have been.&nbsp; Besides the indications of a moat,
which present themselves to the eye, the charter or license of
Henry, given at length by Dugdale, strongly corroborates the
opinion before expressed, with respect to the moat.&nbsp; That
document, as set out by Dugdale, grants to Roger Ive, of Seaton,
rector of the chapel of St. John Baptist, at Adbrighton Hussee,
in the county of Salop, a piece of ground, with all the edifices
and erections on it, within the lordship of Adbrighton Hussee,
near Shrewsbury, situate in the field called Battlefield, in
which a battle had been lately fought between the King and Henry
Percy deceased and other rebels; and by the grace of God, the
King had obtained victory and triumph, which piece of ground is
enclosed with a ditch, and contains in length and breadth two
acres of land, together with two inlets and outlets, one
extending along the lands of Richard Hussee twenty feet, and the

<p>Battlefield is a distinct parish, and was, prior to its
becoming so, in Henry IV.&rsquo;s reign, attached to the then
existing rectory of St. John the Baptist at Adbright Hussee. <a

Mary&rsquo;s parishes, of Shrewsbury, adjoin it.&nbsp; The living

late incumbent; and it is in the patronage of Andrew William
Corbet, Esq., of Sundorne Castle, Shropshire.</p>
<p>The present dilapidated state of the nave of Battlefield
Church is generally ascribed to the Puritans of the time of the
Commonwealth; and a note in the church register, above one
hundred years ago (1749), states, that it was then in its present
ruinous condition. <a name="citation19c"></a><a
href="#footnote19c" class="citation">[19c]</a>&nbsp; The conduct
of those who committed the injury in this instance, brings to
recollection the passage from the Holy
Scriptures:&mdash;&ldquo;But now they break down the carved work
thereof, at once, with axes and hammers.&nbsp; They have cast
fire into thy sanctuary; they have defiled by casting down the
dwelling-place of thy name to the ground.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19d"></a><a href="#footnote19d"
class="citation">[19d]</a></p>
<p>On viewing this ancient church, I could not, either as a
Christian or as an antiquary, see this handsome edifice, which
had been erected by a King of England, in commemoration of an
important historical event, and dedicated to the worship of the
Most High, so injured by violence or neglect, without
experiencing feelings of regret.&nbsp; Still its walls and
remains, in their present state, are truthful records of the
past, and furnish an authentic and valuable example of church
architecture, of the <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>time of Henry IV.&nbsp; The mere
preservation of them from further injury, by time or negligence,
would be laudable; but if the tasteless and ignorant scheme,
which has been suggested, of renovating the church, should ever
unfortunately be carried into effect, great mischief will be
done; the original will be falsified; in its renovated state it
will be a mere imitation; and it will no longer be an interesting
and authentic example of the architectural science of the period
to which it belonged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">England</span> exhibited, during a great
part of the fifteenth century, the mournful spectacle of a
country harassed by rival parties, and exposed to all the horrors
of civil war.&nbsp; Hostile competitors contended for a prize of
no common value; for the crown and dominions of England were to
be the reward of the conqueror.</p>
<p>King Henry VI. was descended from John of Gaunt, Duke of
Lancaster, the fourth son of King Edward III., and the persons
supporting the claim of the House of Lancaster to the throne, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>were from
that circumstance called Lancastrians. <a
name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a>&nbsp; On the other hand, Richard
Plantagenet, Duke of York, with the assistance of some of his
powerful relations and connections, was cautiously but vigilantly
taking measures calculated to secure his accession to the crown,
although at first he did not openly bring forward his pretensions
to it.&nbsp; They were founded upon the fact of the Duke of
York&rsquo;s being descended from Lionel Duke of Clarence, third
son of King Edward III.; <a name="citation22b"></a><a
href="#footnote22b" class="citation">[22b]</a> and the adherents
and supporters of the Duke of York, and of his sons after his
death, received the appellation of Yorkists.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>The
adverse parties encountered each other at St. Alban&rsquo;s on
the 22nd <a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> of May, 1455, where a battle was
fought, and the Duke of York obtained the victory.&nbsp; A hollow
and ineffectual truce, and an outward reconciliation, ensued,
only to be broken in rather more than four years afterwards, when
the hostile parties once more took up arms, and at Blore Heath,
on the borders of Staffordshire, again met in mortal
conflict.</p>
<p>Blore Heath, celebrated for the battle fought in 1459, is in
the parish of Drayton in Hales, or Market Drayton, on the high
road leading from the small market town of Drayton, towards
Newcastle.&nbsp; It is in Staffordshire, two miles and a half
distant from Drayton, and about two miles from the division of
the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.&nbsp; It is eight
miles and a half distant from Eccleshall, and is, as Stow in his
<i>Annals</i> correctly states, near Mucklestone, being only one
mile and a half from the latter place.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>The
town of Drayton is in Shropshire; but the parish of Market
Drayton, or Drayton in Hales, comprises parts both of Shropshire
and Staffordshire, and includes Blore Heath, which, though
formerly a heath, is now completely enclosed and cultivated.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1459, Richard Neville Earl of Salisbury <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a> marched from Middleham Castle, in
Yorkshire, with a considerable army, in support of the cause of
the Duke of York, and entered Staffordshire with the ultimate
intention of effecting a junction at Ludlow, with Richard Neville
Earl of Warwick, called the King Maker, <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a> and also with the Duke of York, who <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>had collected
an army in Herefordshire, and in the marches of Wales.&nbsp; The
Earl of Salisbury, and his son the Earl of Warwick, were noblemen
of very great power and possessions, and were then the principal
leaders of the Duke of York&rsquo;s party, and abettors of the
scheme of deposing King Henry VI., and placing the Duke of York
upon the throne of England.</p>
<p>At that time King Henry VI. was at Coleshill, in Warwickshire,
and Queen Margaret <a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a> and Edward the
young Prince of Wales <a name="citation25b"></a><a
href="#footnote25b" class="citation">[25b]</a> were at
Eccleshall, in Staffordshire; and by her orders, or by those of
her council, James Touchet Lord Audley, <a
name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c"
class="citation">[25c]</a> with a superior force, raised
principally in Cheshire and Shropshire, amounting, as we are
told, to as many as 10,000 men, took up a position on the road to
Drayton, in order to intercept the earl in his march. <a
name="citation25d"></a><a href="#footnote25d"
class="citation">[25d]</a>&nbsp; The earl&rsquo;s army was
inferior in number to that of his antagonist, which was strongly
posted, as will be more fully explained afterwards, with a small
stream in its front.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>This
stream had rather steep banks, which rendered it very hazardous
for the earl and his army to cross it, and attack the
Lancastrians, with a fair prospect of success.&nbsp; In
consequence of those difficulties, the earl resorted to a
military stratagem, with the most fortunate result.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of Sunday, the 23rd of September, 1459
(St. Tecla&rsquo;s day), he caused his archers to shoot flights
of arrows against the Lancastrians.&nbsp; He then feigned a
retreat with his army, which induced Lord Audley, in his
eagerness to pursue them, to pass over the stream with a
considerable portion of his forces, and whilst they were on the
ascent of the ground on the other side of the stream, and were
disordered with effecting the passage, and before he could get
the remainder of his forces over it, or put that portion which
had crossed into order, they were so vigorously attacked by the
Yorkists, that the Lancastrians were completely defeated, and
Lord Audley, with 2400 of his forces, perished on the field.</p>
<p>There were slain in the battle, besides Lord Audley, Hugh
Venables of Kinderton, Thomas Dutton of Dutton, Richard Molyneux
<a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> of Sefton, William Troutbeck, <a

was most disastrous to the Cheshire men, the greatest loss having
fallen upon persons of that county, who had received the young
Prince&rsquo;s badge of the silver swan, which had been
distributed by Queen Margaret amongst the principal partisans of
the Lancastrian party. <a name="citation27a"></a><a

taken prisoners. <a name="citation27c"></a><a href="#footnote27c"

<p>Sir John Neville <a name="citation27d"></a><a

wounded in the battle, and were, with Sir Thomas Harrington,
travelling to the north, when they were taken by some of the
Lancastrians, and sent prisoners to Chester; but in consequence
of a message from the Welsh marchmen, there being good reason to

<p>The Parliamentary Rolls of the same Parliament of Coventry, <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> contain a bill of impeachment, which,
though it never passed into an act, the royal assent having been
refused, is interesting and important, as showing that, although
Thomas Lord Stanley <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>had not then taken up arms for, or avowed himself a
partisan of, the Duke of York&rsquo;s faction, yet he was so
considered by that Parliament; besides which, his brother William
Stanley came, with many of Lord Stanley&rsquo;s servants and
tenants, and fought on the side of the Yorkists, at Blore
Heath.&nbsp; It is material to bear in mind, that Thomas Lord
Stanley (afterwards first Earl of Derby, of that surname),
married Eleanor Neville, daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, and
sister of Richard Earl of Warwick (the King Maker); which
circumstance, in addition to the violence of party, may easily
account for the conduct of Lord Stanley, and of his brother
William Stanley, on the occasion of that battle.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[&ldquo;Responsio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have in several successive years <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a> paid visits to the field of
battle.&nbsp; At the distance of two miles and a half on the road
from Drayton, and soon after entering Staffordshire, the stream
before mentioned, which is scarcely large enough to be considered
a river, crosses the road; and more than once when I have visited
it, it contained so little water, that I could easily have
skipped over it.&nbsp; It is called Hemp Mill Brook, and is a
tributary of the river Tern; its banks are rather steep, and it
flows through a narrow valley, over which the road is now carried
by a modern bridge.&nbsp; At present, from the raising and
improving of the road, and probably from its having been in some
degree turned, the descent on either side to the bridge is not
great; but at the period when the battle was fought, the position
of the Lancastrians must have been strong, in consequence of the
height of the banks of Hemp Mill Brook, the depression of the
valley, and the abrupt ascent from the stream on the Drayton
side, where the Lancastrians were posted; and there is no reason
to suppose that at that period there was a bridge over the
stream.&nbsp; The place is evidently much changed, yet even now
sufficient remains to show that they were strongly posted.</p>
<p>The exact spot where the battle was fought is easily
identified.&nbsp; After the traveller has crossed the modern
bridge and ascended the rising ground at Blore Heath, by the road
leading from Drayton towards Newcastle, he will observe, at a
couple of fields&rsquo; breadth beyond the stream, and on the
right side of the road, a field called the Cross Field, which at
present is entered by the third gate on the right from the
bridge.&nbsp; This field extends from the road in a curved form
backwards, and slopes down the <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>declivity, until it reaches the
stream at another point at a little distance from the bridge.</p>
<p>The battle of Blore Heath was fought on the spot where the
Cross Field and the other fields near it on each side of the road
now are; but, as the name implies, it should seem that the field
of battle was open and unenclosed, in 1459.&nbsp; Near the middle
of the Cross Field, Lord Audley is said to have been slain.&nbsp;
A square pedestal, seemingly of great age, with a rude stone
cross standing upon it, now much battered and injured, has been
erected to mark the spot where he fell.&nbsp; On the pedestal is
the following inscription, which is a good deal worn by
time:&mdash;</p>

<p>Plot, in his <i>Natural History of Staffordshire</i>, <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a> published in 1686, mentions, amongst
the antiquities of that county, &ldquo;The stone set up upon
Blore Heath, in memory of the fall of James Lord Audley, slain
just in that place;&rdquo; which is an additional proof of an
ancient monument having been there, during a long period of
time.</p>
<p>Opposite the gate of the Cross Field, and at the distance of a
field&rsquo;s breadth, on the other side of the road, is a
farmhouse and <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>farm called Audley Cross Farm, of which that field forms
a part.&nbsp; The farm belongs to Sir John N. L. Chetwode, Bart.,
and is occupied by Mr. William Hughes, a respectable and
intelligent farmer, with whom I have had several conversations,
during the visits which I made to the field of battle, as I was
in hopes of hearing from him of some relics having been dug up;
but he had not held the farm many years, and was not aware of any
discoveries of that nature having been recently made.&nbsp; He,
however, informed me, that some relics of the battle had formerly
been discovered.&nbsp; On the 16th of May, 1856, I saw in the
possession of Mr. George Goodall, a respectable farmer residing
in that neighbourhood, a sword in tolerable preservation, which
is said to have been found on the field of battle. <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>Near the back of the farmhouse, in a little enclosure, is a
small raised mount of earth, of a long square shape, on which a
thorn-tree of rather large size is growing, which is said to have
been raised in memory of some person of distinction who was slain
there.&nbsp; If that be so, the probability is, that he was one
of the Yorkists, because it is a little in the rear of the spot
where their right wing must have been.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>It is
impossible for any one, to read the accounts of the old
chroniclers and annalists, and to inspect the field of battle,
without being struck with the remarkable resemblance, between the
spot, and the descriptions of it, meagre as they may be, which
they have left us.&nbsp; The stream crossing the high road, by
which the Earl of Salisbury would naturally advance from Cheshire
and Staffordshire, on his march towards Ludlow, the strong
position of the Lancastrians, the name of Blore Heath (still
preserved ages after the place had ceased to be a heath), and its
contiguity to Mucklestone, as well as to Drayton, all which
circumstances are mentioned by the ancient historians, combine,
independently of tradition, to place the locality beyond dispute.

proceeded towards London.&nbsp; In passing through Kent they were
joined by Cobham <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> and many other personages of
influence; and on the 2nd of July, 1460, they entered London,
with a great accession to their forces, where they were
cheerfully received by the Mayor and citizens, and of which they
took quiet possession, except the Tower, into which Lord Scales
<a name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"
class="citation">[40c]</a> and other Lancastrian leaders had
retired, and which <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

for its surrender, the Earls of March and Warwick, with the Lords
Falconberg <a name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"

href="#footnote41d" class="citation">[41d]</a> and <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>other bishops
and noblemen, left London with an army, a great portion of which
came out of Kent, Essex, Surrey, and Sussex, amounting
altogether, as some writers state, to 25,000 men, and proceeded
towards Henry VI., <a name="citation42a"></a><a
href="#footnote42a" class="citation">[42a]</a> leaving the Earl
of Salisbury, Cobham, and Sir John Wenlock, in London, to take
care of the city, keep the citizens firm in their fidelity, and
push the siege of the Tower. <a name="citation42b"></a><a
href="#footnote42b" class="citation">[42b]</a></p>
<p>Henry VI. was at Coventry when the confederate earls were in
Kent.&nbsp; On receiving intelligence of what was taking place in
London, he&mdash;or, perhaps, it would be more correct to say,
Queen Margaret, <a name="citation42c"></a><a href="#footnote42c"
class="citation">[42c]</a> in his name, obtained money by
compositions for knighthood, and loans from the prelates and
convents, and from such of the nobility as were attached to the
Lancastrian party, and raised a large army to provide for his
defence, and <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>proceeded with the Duke of Somerset, <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a> who had recently arrived from Guisnes,
the Duke of Buckingham, <a name="citation43b"></a><a
href="#footnote43b" class="citation">[43b]</a> and other noblemen
and knights, to Northampton, where the King took up his abode at
the Friary. <a name="citation43c"></a><a href="#footnote43c"
class="citation">[43c]</a></p>
<p>The confederate earls, at the head of the Yorkist army,
proceeded northward to meet Henry, and took up a position between
Towcester and Northampton. <a name="citation43d"></a><a
href="#footnote43d" class="citation">[43d]</a></p>
<p>Queen Margaret, judging from the power of the Lancastrians
assembled at Northampton, that they were fully able to meet in
hostile conflict the forces of the Yorkists, took upon herself to
encourage <a name="citation43e"></a><a href="#footnote43e"
class="citation">[43e]</a> her friends and supporters; and when
the whole of the King&rsquo;s forces were assembled, they issued
out of Northampton, and, crossing the river Nen, or Nene,
proceeded into the meadows on the southward side of the town, and
in that part of them which is close to Delapr&eacute; Abbey, <a
name="citation43f"></a><a href="#footnote43f"
class="citation">[43f]</a> a religious house <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of Cluniac
nuns in the parish of Hardingstone, strongly intrenched
themselves, <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> and awaited the arrival of their
enemies, and prepared to fight them there.&nbsp; The position, in
a military point of view, was most ill judged.&nbsp; It possessed
no natural advantages, but the contrary; for, by placing
themselves on the southward side of the river, which seems to
have been done with a view to deprive their adversaries of the
advantage of having it in their front, the Lancastrians seem to
have lost sight of the peril and chance of destruction, in case
of defeat, from having the river in their own rear; an error
which caused most lamentable consequences to them after the
battle.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Salisbury, with the assent of the other bishops
and of the noblemen who were on the side of the Yorkists, was
sent to the King with pacific overtures, but without any
satisfactory result; for, although somewhat inferior in numbers,
the Lancastrians seem to have been over confident in their
forces, and in the strength of their position.&nbsp; In the night
the Yorkists removed their camp towards Northampton, and both
parties prepared for battle.</p>
<p>On the 9th <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> of July, 1460, the Earls of Warwick
and March, accompanied by Viscount Bourchier, Lord Falconberg,
and others, advanced with their forces, and the battle commenced
about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; According to one
account, their van was led by the Earl of Warwick, and after him
followed <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>the Earl of March, with the banner of his father; others
state that the Earl of March commanded the van, the Earl of
Warwick the middle, and Lord Falconberg the rear body.&nbsp;
During the battle, Edmund Lord Grey, of Ruthen, <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a> who was in the Lancastrian army,
betrayed his trust, and, having a command in a part of the
King&rsquo;s camp, where, in consequence of a deep trench, and of
a rampart, fortified with piles and sharp stakes, with which the
camp was encompassed, so that the Yorkists could not enter
without great danger, he and his men assisted the Yorkists to get
within the intrenchments, and greatly conduced to the defeat of
the Lancastrians. <a name="citation45b"></a><a
href="#footnote45b" class="citation">[45b]</a></p>
<p>Another circumstance occurred which was a great disadvantage
to the Lancastrians: there was a considerable fall of rain on
that day, and the cannons, with which the camp of the King was in
some degree at least, defended, were prevented by the wet, from
being of the service that they otherwise might have been. <a
name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c"
class="citation">[45c]</a></p>
<p>The battle however lasted some time, with obstinacy and
fierceness, the victory being uncertain until nine o&rsquo;clock,
when the King&rsquo;s army was completely defeated.&nbsp; Many of
his forces <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>were slain in the battle and in their flight towards the
town, and great numbers were drowned in the river Nen; <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> for, as before observed, it was in
their rear, and consequently between them and Northampton, and it
proved a most serious disadvantage to the fugitives, when flying
towards the town; so that the Lancastrians felt, to their
grievous loss, the impolicy of taking up a position with the
river in their rear.&nbsp; The King was left to his fate by the
vanquished, and was speedily captured by the victors. <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a></p>
<p>Amongst other persons of distinction on the Lancastrian side,
slain in the battle, were the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of
Shrewsbury, <a name="citation46c"></a><a href="#footnote46c"
class="citation">[46c]</a> his brother Sir Christopher Talbot,
Viscount Beaumont, <a name="citation46d"></a><a
href="#footnote46d" class="citation">[46d]</a> Lord Egremont, <a
name="citation46e"></a><a href="#footnote46e"
class="citation">[46e]</a> and Sir William Lucy, who <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>hastened to
take a part in the fight, and immediately on joining in it,
received his death wound, by a blow on the head, with an
axe.&nbsp; A considerable slaughter amongst persons of
distinction, is said to have been caused by the Yorkist leaders
directing their men to spare the common soldiers, but to despatch
the noblemen, knights, and gentlemen.&nbsp; Many of the
Lancastrians, however, were taken prisoners, in consequence of
their having alighted from their horses, to fight on foot; a mode
of fighting very likely to be adopted, when it is borne in mind
that they were to fight behind intrenchments.</p>
<p>The Duke of Somerset and others narrowly escaped, and fled
with Queen Margaret, and Edward Prince of Wales, <a
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a> into the bishopric of Durham.</p>
<p>The confederate earls having obtained the victory, waited upon
the King with all outward show of respect; but immediately
conveyed him to London, and lodged him in the bishop&rsquo;s
palace.</p>
<p>The body of the Duke of Buckingham was interred in the church
of the Grey Friars <a name="citation47b"></a><a
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a> at Northampton;
that of the Earl of <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Shrewsbury was conveyed to Worksop, <a
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> and there buried; those of some of the
leaders were interred in the Hospital of St. John, in Bridge
Street, in Northampton;<a name="citation48b"></a><a
href="#footnote48b" class="citation">[48b]</a> and others in the
Abbey Delapr&eacute;, adjacent to the field of battle; <a
name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a> but the exact spot where the cemetery
of the abbey was situated is not now known.</p>
<p>The Duke of Buckingham was of royal lineage, <a
name="citation48d"></a><a href="#footnote48d"
class="citation">[48d]</a> being the <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>son and heir of Edmund Stafford,
fifth Earl of Stafford, by Anne Plantagenet, daughter of Thomas
of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, youngest son of King Edward
III.&nbsp; A strange and mournful fatality attended the principal
members of the great and powerful family of the Duke of
Buckingham, during five generations.&nbsp; The father, son,
grandson, great-grandson, and great-great-grandson, all died
violent deaths.&nbsp; Edmund Stafford, fifth Earl of Stafford,
was slain fighting on the part of Henry IV., at the battle of
Shrewsbury, in 1403; his son, Humphrey Stafford, first Duke of
Buckingham, was slain at the battle of Northampton, fighting for
the Lancastrian party, in 1460; his son, Humphrey, Earl of
Stafford, was slain at the first battle of St. Alban&rsquo;s,
also fighting for that party, in 1455; his son, Henry Stafford,
second Duke of Buckingham, was beheaded in the first year of
Richard III., in 1483; <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a> and his son, Edward
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Stafford,
the third and last Duke of Buckingham of that family, was
beheaded in the thirteenth year of Henry VIII., in 1521.</p>
<p>I carefully searched for, but could not discover, any remains
of intrenchments, and, although I made inquiries, I was unable to
learn that any traces of them could be recollected by persons on
the spot; but there is sufficiently clear information, given by
the old historical writers, to enable a person fond of such
investigations, to identify the place where the battle took
place; and their accounts show that it was fought close to
Northampton, <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> in the meadows on the southward side
of the town, <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> and of the river Nen or Nene, and
adjoining Delapr&eacute; Abbey, <a name="citation50a"></a><a
href="#footnote50a" class="citation">[50a]</a> in the parish of
Hardingstone, and near Queen Eleanor&rsquo;s Cross. <a
name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a>&nbsp; The field of battle is now
occupied by beautiful plantations, pleasure-grounds, and a
portion of the park of Edward Bouverie, Esq., <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> formerly part of the meadows before
mentioned; and the railway <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>from Northampton to Peterborough,
passes over one side of them.</p>
<p>The mansion of Delapr&eacute; Abbey stands upon the site of
the old abbey of that name, and some portions of the walls, and
two or three small arches or doorways, of the old abbey, are yet
to be seen, in the interior of the present mansion.</p>
<p>As the meadows are skirted by the river Nen, which flows on
the south side of Northampton, and separates the town from them,
it follows, that when the Lancastrians marched out of the town,
and took up a position in the meadows, and had the town and river
close to them in their rear, they faced to the southward.</p>
<p>As the Yorkists marched from London, and proceeded to a place
between Towcester and Northampton, it appears pretty certain that
they advanced by Blisworth, and by the present turnpike road, and
passed close to the beautiful and interesting monument of
antiquity, Queen Eleanor&rsquo;s Cross, which stands not much
more than a mile from Northampton.&nbsp; The land is rather
elevated in the vicinity of the cross, and slopes down to the
mansion of Delapr&eacute; Abbey, and to the park and
pleasure-grounds belonging to it; and the Yorkists would
naturally face to the northward, when attacking the
Lancastrians.&nbsp; I was unable to learn, upon inquiry, that any
relics of the battle had been dug up upon the field; and, as it
is now part of the park and pleasure-grounds, the probability of
the discovery of them by any excavations, ploughing, or digging,
is consequently much diminished.</p>
<p>The victory was productive of most important advantages to the
Yorkists.&nbsp; The Lancastrians were dismayed by the loss of the
battle, the captivity of King Henry, and the deaths of so many of
their leaders; and the defenders of the Tower of London,
straitened by the want of provisions, surrendered
immediately.&nbsp; The Duke of York, <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> who was in Ireland
when the battle <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>was fought, hearing of its successful result, returned
to London; and although he did not succeed in getting himself
recognised as King of England, he was declared by Parliament to
be Henry&rsquo;s successor; besides which, without waiting for
Henry&rsquo;s death, he was at once intrusted with the power,
though not the title, of King; for he was appointed Protector and
Regent of the whole realm.</p>

<p>Richard Duke of York, <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a> desirous to
disperse a considerable body of troops, which Queen Margaret <a
name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c"
class="citation">[53c]</a> was assembling in the North, marched
from London on the 2nd of December, 1460, with a small army, and
proceeded into Yorkshire, whilst his eldest son, Edward Earl of
March, afterwards King Edward IV., went into Herefordshire, and
to the borders of Wales, to levy a large body of forces, in order
to assist his father, <a name="citation53d"></a><a
href="#footnote53d" class="citation">[53d]</a> and intended <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>to follow him
with an army, to his castle of Sandal, near Wakefield.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the Duke of York took up his position, at
Sandal; and his friends, retainers, and tenants, speedily began
to assemble around him.&nbsp; Margaret marched with diligence
from York, <a name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> with the Duke of Exeter, <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"

class="citation">[57]</a> <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and many of the knights and gentry of
the northern parts, at the head of about 18,000 men, and advanced
before Sandal, with the object of attacking him before his forces
were fully mustered.&nbsp; It is certain that the Duke of
York&rsquo;s army was much inferior in numbers, and some accounts
state, that he was only at the head of 5000 men.&nbsp; It is said
that he was advised by his officers, in a council of war, not to
risk an engagement, until his son Edward could arrive with the
Welsh march-men.&nbsp; Several reasons have been conjectured, why
the Duke of York came to the fatal conclusion, to hazard the
chances of a battle; but it is very probable, that the true
reason may be found, in the impossibility of provisioning a
considerable body of troops, in the depth of winter, at Sandal,
when no previous preparation had been made for them; or that he
was ignorant of the great disproportion in numbers, between the
two armies.&nbsp; Some of the historical accounts state, that he
imagined that the main body of the Lancastrians who presented
themselves and offered battle under the command of the Duke of
Somerset, constituted all the army with which he had to fight,
and that he was not aware of the fact, that there were other
bodies of troops on each of its flanks, but at some distance, and
concealed from his observation, one commanded by the Earl of
Wiltshire, and the other by Lord Clifford.&nbsp; It is not,
however, very easy to understand, <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>how it could be possible, with the
advantage of overlooking the flat country occupied by the
Lancastrians, that two considerable bodies of them could be so
placed, as to be near enough to assist the main body, without
being observed by him.</p>
<p>Sandal Castle stood upon an eminence upon which the Yorkists
were posted, which extends a considerable distance, and gradually
slopes down towards the meadows on the northward, and towards
Wakefield on the north-westward side.</p>
<p>Having determined on a battle, the duke and his forces, on the
31st <a name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> of December, 1460, descended the
eminence and furiously attacked the Lancastrians.&nbsp; The
battle was fought at the place then called Wakefield Green, <a
name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a> and the result was such as might have
been foreseen.&nbsp; His array nearly surrounded and overwhelmed
by numbers, was completely defeated.</p>
<p>The Duke of York, and about 2800 of his forces, were slain,
amongst whom were William Bonvile, commonly called Lord
Harrington; <a name="citation58c"></a><a href="#footnote58c"
class="citation">[58c]</a> Sir David Hall, Sir Hugh Hastings, Sir
John Mortimer, Sir Hugh Mortimer; Sir Thomas Neville, third son
of the Earl of Salisbury; <a name="citation58d"></a><a
href="#footnote58d" class="citation">[58d]</a> Sir Edward
Bourchier, son of the Earl of Ewe (afterwards of Essex); Reginald
Grey, the third son of Edward Lord Ferrers of Groby; and
abundance of the gentry of the south of England.&nbsp; The Earl
of Salisbury <a name="citation58d"></a><a href="#footnote58d"
class="citation">[58d]</a> was wounded, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>taken
prisoner, and sent the next day to Pontefract, and there
beheaded, with some other persons of distinction; and their
heads, with that of the Duke of York, were afterwards fixed on
the gates or walls of York: that of the duke having a paper crown
upon it, in derision of his claims to the throne.&nbsp; This act
of barbarity is alluded to by Shakespeare, who attributes to
Queen Margaret the expression, after the death of the Duke of
York,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Off with his head and set it on York
gates<br />
So York may overlook the town of York.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The victory was closely followed by an act of shocking
wickedness and barbarity.&nbsp; Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of
Rutland, a son of the Duke of York, a boy only twelve years old,
was captured when flying with his tutor from the field of battle,
and was put to death near Wakefield Bridge, by Lord Clifford: a
murder which obtained for him during the very short remainder of
his life, the epithet of &ldquo;the Butcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An extract from the act of attainder, which was passed after
the accession of Edward IV. to the throne, against the
Lancastrians, is interesting, as giving a list of such of them as
took a part at the battle of Wakefield.</p>

<p>As the city of York, from whence Queen Margaret advanced with
the Lancastrians, lies on the north-eastward of the village and
castle of Sandal, it might have been inferred, that the road by
which she advanced, was that through Pontefract, on the eastward
side of the river Calder.&nbsp; Wakefield and its bridge over the
Calder, are on the north-westward side of Sandal; and if <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the Earl of
Rutland, at the time when he was captured, were trying to effect
his escape, by Wakefield Bridge, it might be supposed, that
during the fight, that side of the field of battle was in the
rear of the Yorkists, and consequently was open and unoccupied by
the Lancastrians. <a name="citation61a"></a><a
href="#footnote61a" class="citation">[61a]</a>&nbsp; But that is
not reconcileable with the fact, that previously to the battle,
the Duke of York&rsquo;s army was posted at Sandal, and that the
battle was fought between Wakefield and Sandal, and upon
Wakefield Green; because in that case, Wakefield and its bridge,
must of necessity have been in the possession of the
Lancastrians; and if so, they naturally must have advanced from
York to Wakefield on the west side of the Calder.&nbsp; It seems
probable, that when the Earl of Rutland was captured in his
flight, his capture took place at some spot other than Wakefield
Bridge, and that he was brought a prisoner to Lord Clifford, who
murdered him on or near the bridge.</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, 1852, <a name="citation61b"></a><a
href="#footnote61b" class="citation">[61b]</a> I first visited
the field of battle, the castle, and also the village and church
of Sandal.&nbsp; The church has not any old monuments to boast
of; and I could not discover that any monument whatever, which
had any relation to persons slain at the battle, had ever existed
there.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Westmorland, recently the vicar of
Sandal, now of Leominster, has, however, very kindly sent me a
copy of an inscription in old characters apparently of about that
age; but I am far from saying, that it had any reference, to any
individual named Percy, connected with that battle,
viz.:&mdash;&ldquo;Orate pro bono statu Joselynni Pyrcy
Armigery.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am also indebted to him, and to William
Shaw, Esq., of Porto Bello <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>House, for some valuable information
upon some other points.&nbsp; Looking from Sandal Castle Hill, a
flat plain appears, of considerable extent, cultivated as meadow
fields, extending from the castle to the river Calder.&nbsp;
Those meadows are at present called &ldquo;the
Pugnays.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are designated &ldquo;the
Pukenills,&rdquo; on the Manor Court Rolls, which are still in
existence, and of a date prior to the fourteenth century.&nbsp;
Adjoining the tract of meadow-land, and in the extreme
north-westward, bounded by the river Calder, is &ldquo;Porto
Bello,&rdquo; a mansion erected by Samuel Holdsworth, Esq., and
now occupied by William Shaw, Esq.&nbsp; The battle was fought
upon that spot, upon part of the meadow-land before mentioned,
and upon the tract of ground formerly part of Wakefield Green,
extending from thence across the turnpike road in a
north-eastwardly direction.&nbsp; The green must have been at
that time a large open tract of ground, but it has long been
enclosed, and its position appears to have been on the southward
side of, and about half a mile from the bridge; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a> its site is crossed by the modern
turnpike road, from Wakefield to Barnsley, and part of it has
acquired the name of Fall Ings, according to tradition, from the
great numbers who fell there, in the battle.</p>
<p>There are now no remains of Wakefield Green: all of it has
been enclosed, and several portions of it are built upon; and it
is worthy of notice, that on one side of the spot, where the
green is said to have been, the ground descends from Sandal to
the present turnpike road, and to a tract of level ground close
to Porto Bello House; and that, at a little distance further on
the turnpike road leading towards Wakefield, there is a slight
elevation in the road, and in the contiguous fields.&nbsp; After
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>carefully
viewing the ground, I came to the conclusion that this little
elevation, which faces the high ground at Sandal, must be
considered to have been the position of the Lancastrians; and
also that the battle was fought upon the level ground between it
and Sandal, extending on the one side towards Porto Bello House,
and on the other to the Fall Ings, and towards the Pontefract
road.&nbsp; In digging the foundations of Porto Bello House, and
in forming the sunk fence there, human bones, broken swords,
spurs, and other relics, were discovered, which were considered
fully confirmatory of that locality having been the scene of the
conflict.&nbsp; On the northern part of Fall Ings, near the side
where the highway to Pontefract runs, fragments of armour, and
other indications, apparently of the battle, are said to have
been discovered some time ago, in making an excavation
there.&nbsp; It was also the spot, and on the side of Sandal,
where the battle would naturally take place, after the advance of
the Lancastrians from York to Wakefield; and it tallies with the
accounts handed down to us, that the battle was fought between
Wakefield and Sandal, and upon Wakefield Green.</p>
<p>There has not been discovered, within the memory of man, any
large trench or pit near Sandal Church, where it might reasonably
be supposed that some of the slain would be interred, such as has
been discovered at Battlefield Church, in consequence of the
battle of Shrewsbury, and at Saxton Church, in consequence of the
battle of Towton. <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a></p>
<p>Sandal Castle has not been an extensive one; and, except that
its position was on an eminence, it was devoid of the natural
advantages which many castles possess, such as being built on the
margin of rivers, or the edges of steep precipices.&nbsp; All
that now exists of it, consists of rather large mounds, on which
the outworks and walls have stood; two shattered and not large
fragments of the latter remain, but so imperfect, that it is not
possible to ascertain of what part of the castle they originally
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>formed a
portion.&nbsp; The moat is tolerably perfect; indeed in one
place, it contained water when I visited it, although the season
was hot and dry.&nbsp; There is also a very large and high mount,
in a considerable degree artificial, on which the keep has stood,
almost encompassed by an inner moat, which is of considerable
depth.</p>
<p>In the additions to Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>, it is
stated, with reference to the death of the Duke of York, that the
spot where he fell was enclosed with a triangular wall, including
about a rood or ten feet, now converted into a garden, the owners
being obliged to keep it hedged in; that a large stone cross
raised on it, was demolished in the civil war; that here was
found a large gold ring, supposed to have belonged to the duke,
and given to Mr. Thoresby; on the sale of whose museum, Mr.
Bartlet, who remembered the finding of it, bought it for two
guineas; that within is engraved, &ldquo;Pour bon amour,&rdquo;
and on the broad outside are &ldquo;three saints.&rdquo; <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a></p>
<p>On the right side of the old road leading from Wakefield to
Barnsley, which passes the castle, and is called Sandal Castle
Lane, <a name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a> is a small field or close, of rather a
triangular form, which is said to be the spot where the Duke of
York fell. <a name="citation64c"></a><a href="#footnote64c"
class="citation">[64c]</a>&nbsp; It will <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>scarcely
admit of any doubt, that this is the identical place which is
mentioned in the addition to Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>,
although there is not a vestige of the cross now left.&nbsp; As
the place is rather nearer to the castle than to the field of
battle, it is not unreasonable to infer that the Duke of York may
have been mortally wounded, and have been removed to a little
distance in the rear (the spot in question would be in the rear
of the Yorkists&rsquo; army), or he may have endeavoured to
escape, on finding that the day was against him, and may have
been slain there in his flight.&nbsp; The strong probability is,
that it is the place where he fell.&nbsp; The small field or
close may easily be distinguished: it lies about a mile from
Wakefield Bridge; and at a very trifling distance beyond the
toll-bar, a little well will be remarked, in the hedge, on the
right side of the old road to Barnsley; and about midway between
the toll-bar and the well, the small field or close presents
itself to view.&nbsp; It is remarkable for having two very old
willows growing in the hedge adjoining the road; and more of them
were not very long ago growing there.&nbsp; A small compartment
of the field was, within the recollection of the recent vicar of
Sandal, fenced off from the remainder of it, and planted with red
and white roses, which must naturally be supposed to have been
done to commemorate the battle, or the death of the Duke of York.

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> victory gained by the
Lancastrians, at the battle of Wakefield, seemed at the first
view, to decide the fate of the adverse party.&nbsp; Richard Duke
of York, the claimant to the throne, and the leader of the
Yorkists, was slain; Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, was
wounded, taken prisoner, and afterwards beheaded at Pontefract;
and the army of which they were commanders, was completely
destroyed.&nbsp; A most formidable enemy, however, soon presented
himself to notice.&nbsp; Edward Earl of March, <a
name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a> the <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>eldest son of the Duke of York, was
considered by great numbers of persons, as the rightful heir to
the throne of England; he was descended from the Mortimers, Earls
of March, and had claims to the crown, from his descent through
his mother&rsquo;s side, from Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son
of Edward III., through Philippa (the only daughter and heiress
of the Duke of Clarence), who married Roger Mortimer, third Earl
of March and Lord of Wigmore; besides which, he was also
descended from Edward III. in another manner, because his
great-grandfather, Edmund of Langley, was the fifth son of Edward
III.&nbsp; He was a young man whose personal appearance and
manners were very prepossessing; he gained the hearts of men in a
warlike age, by his courage and excellence in martial exercises;
and his noble and powerful alliances, combined with his lineal
descent from the great families of Plantagenet and Mortimer, had
a potent influence in his favour, with vast numbers of all ranks;
besides which, he was young, talented, and daring, and was well
qualified under those circumstances to fight his way to a
throne.</p>
<p>At the time when his father perished at Wakefield, Edward was
occupied, by the direction of the former, in raising forces in
the marches and the borders of Wales: a district where he had
immense patrimonial possessions, and where the circumstance of
his being of the lineage of the Mortimers, gave him great sway
and influence.&nbsp; He was at Gloucester when he received the
account of his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; After having raised a
large army, which some writers have stated to have amounted to as
many as <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>23,000 men, he prepared to march against Queen Margaret,
and avenge the death of his father.</p>
<p>Edward had, according to the accounts given by several of the
old historians, proceeded as far as Shrewsbury, when he received
tidings, that James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire, <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> and Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a> half brother to King <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Henry the
Sixth, had assembled a large army of Welsh and <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Irish, in
order to attack him; and Edward, in consequence <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>of that
intelligence, <a name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a> was induced to return promptly in
order to encounter them.</p>
<p>The two hostile armies met and fought, on Candlemas Day, the
2nd of February, 1461, <a name="citation72b"></a><a
href="#footnote72b" class="citation">[72b]</a> in the parish of
Kingsland, in Herefordshire, between Leominster and Wigmore, not
far from East Hereford, and very near Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross; <a
name="citation72c"></a><a href="#footnote72c"
class="citation">[72c]</a> from which place the battle acquired
its name.</p>
<p>In those days the appearance of so unusual a phenomenon in the
sky, as a parhelion, or mock sun, was considered a strange and
unheard-of prodigy, which had its weight with ignorant men, as an
omen of good or bad fortune, exciting within them either hopes or
fears.&nbsp; The rare phenomenon, of the appearance of three suns
in the sky, presented itself to view, on the morning of the
battle; and, after showing themselves for some time, they
suddenly joined and seemed to form one sun.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three glorious suns, each one a perfect
sun;<br />
Not separated by the racking clouds,<br />
But sever&rsquo;d in a pale clear shining sky.<br />
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,<br />
As if they vow&rsquo;d some league inviolable:<br />
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Edward
had the sagacity to affect to believe, or really did believe,
that this natural phenomenon <a name="citation73a"></a><a
href="#footnote73a" class="citation">[73a]</a> was an omen of his
success.&nbsp; He afterwards, in commemoration of it, assumed the
sun in its splendour, as his device or badge. <a
name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a></p>
<p>Edward with his forces courageously attacked <a
name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c"
class="citation">[73c]</a> the forces of the Earls of Pembroke
and Wiltshire, and after a severe battle, completely defeated
them; and about 3800 of the Lancastrians were slain.&nbsp; The
Earls of Pembroke and of Wiltshire escaped by flight; Sir Owen
Tudor, <a name="citation73d"></a><a href="#footnote73d"
class="citation">[73d]</a> father of the Earl of Pembroke, and
second husband of Queen Katherine, the widow of Henry V., and the
mother of Henry VI., was taken prisoner, beheaded at Hereford,
and was buried in a chapel of the Grey Friars Church; <a
name="citation73e"></a><a href="#footnote73e"
class="citation">[73e]</a> <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and Sir John Scudamore and his two
sons, David Lloyd, Morgan ap Reuther, Thomas Griffith, John
Throckmorton, Thomas Fitzhenry, and other gentlemen of
consideration, were also taken and beheaded there: a fearful
retaliation for the murder of the young Earl of Rutland, and the
execution in cold blood, by the Lancastrians, of some of the
prisoners, who had been taken at the battle of Wakefield. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a></p>
<p>The victorious Edward then proceeded with his army to join the
King-making Earl of Warwick, who had recently been defeated by
the Lancastrians at the second battle of St. Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
They effected a junction at Chipping Norton, near Cotswold, and,
with their united armies, marched towards London, where Edward
was proclaimed King by his partisans shortly after his
arrival.</p>
<p>The field of the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross is in the
parish of Kingsland, five mile north-west by west from
Leominster, close to the fifth milestone of the turnpike road,
leading from Leominster to Wigmore and Knighton, at the place
where a byroad joins the turnpike road, and where a stone
pedestal or monument, which will be more particularly mentioned
afterwards, stands at the point of junction of those two roads,
which was erected to commemorate the battle. <a
name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross is nearly
a mile and a quarter further on the turnpike road, leading
towards Wigmore.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be taken for granted, that the old historical
accounts are correct in stating, that previous to the battle,
Edward had marched as far as Shrewsbury, had returned to meet the
Earls of Pembroke and Wiltshire, and that the two <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>earls had
raised a large portion of their forces in Wales; and if so, it is
tolerably certain that the Lancastrians advanced from Wales into
Herefordshire, towards the Earl of March&rsquo;s possessions <a
name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a"
class="citation">[75a]</a> at Wigmore and on the borders of
Wales; consequently the vicinity of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross was a
very natural spot for the hostile armies to meet.&nbsp; There is
a gentle ascent in the road from Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross to the
field of battle, and to the spot where the pedestal stands,
consequently the Yorkists had a slight advantage of ground; and
they were drawn up facing the westward, whilst the Lancastrian
army faced the eastward.</p>
<p>Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross is not a village, but merely consists
of a respectable but small country inn, called the
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross Inn, and one or two other houses, at a
junction of four roads; where in former times a cross is said to
have been erected by one of the Mortimers; but it has long been
removed, and I could not learn, upon inquiry, that it had been
there within the memory of man.</p>
<p>Relics of the conflict have been occasionally dug up in the
fields in front (to the westward) of the pedestal, and of the
point of junction of the two roads.&nbsp; When I first visited
the field of battle, on the 16th of May, 1854, I met with a
husbandman at work there, who had lived near it many years, and
who informed me, that some years ago, in ploughing in the next
fields immediately to the right and left of the turnpike road,
after leaving the pedestal and the place of junction of the two
roads, he had not unfrequently discovered remains of bridle-bits,
stirrups, fragments of iron, and, amongst others, long pieces of
iron, which, from their shape and size, he concluded had been
sword-blades, besides other indications of the battle.</p>
<p>Within the recollection of the Rev. R. D. Evans, rector of
Kingsland, some arms, swords, and spear-heads, were found on <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the field of
battle, and were presented to the Museum at Hereford. <a
name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a>&nbsp; He also showed me, when I
visited the field of battle in 1856, a large buckle, perfectly
plain, conjectured to have formed part of the trappings of a
horse; a small buckle, rather ornamented, probably intended for a
sword-belt, both of iron or steel; and a small silver coin,
seemingly a groat, all found upon the field of battle in 1854. <a
name="citation76b"></a><a href="#footnote76b"
class="citation">[76b]</a>&nbsp; I have also been informed by
him, that there was within his recollection, in a close near the
field of battle, a mound said to have been a place of burial of
those slain in the battle, but that it is now quite ploughed
down, and no vestige of it remains.&nbsp; Although the field of
battle is now entirely enclosed, there were old persons living,
when I visited it in 1855 and 1856, who recollected large parts
of it, when the thorn fences of its enclosures were small, and
not much grown, from having been recently planted, and even when
a portion of the land near the pedestal was open and
unenclosed.</p>
<p>The ruins of Wigmore Castle are little more than four miles
further than the field of battle, on the road from Leominster,
from which it is about nine miles and a half distant; and when I
was on three occasions in the neighbourhood, I did not hesitate
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to prolong
my excursion, and visit the remains of a castle which in days of
yore was of importance, and a principal residence of the
Mortimers and of Richard Duke of York.&nbsp; Leland does not give
any information of moment respecting the castle, but merely
states concisely, &ldquo;Wigmore Castle a <span
class="GutSmall">XX</span> myles from Shreusbiri, standing on a
Brooket sumtime almost dry.&rdquo; <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p>The ruins are upon a considerable eminence, and are sadly
shattered, both by time and wilful spoliation, though they still
are interesting, and of commanding appearance.</p>
<p>So much of the castle has been destroyed, that it is not
possible to determine with accuracy its original plan and
arrangements.&nbsp; Some of the outside walls, an arch, and other
small parts of the principal gateway, and some considerable
portions of the keep, still remain, much of which are covered
with ivy; the moat is also tolerably perfect in most places; and
the ruins of the keep stand within the castle upon a naturally
high elevation, which has been considerably raised by artificial
means.&nbsp; The keep has formerly been further strengthened by
an interior moat, which separated it from the rest of the
castle.</p>
<p>Most of the walls have been built of a slaty kind of stone,
which has a tendency to splinter and crumble from the effects of
the weather and frost, so that the remains do not appear likely
to have a very long continuance.&nbsp; In approaching the
entrance, there are some appearances visible, of a rampart and
ditch, extending to the right, and also for a little distance to
the left, of the gateway; there are not, however, any signs of
masonry upon the rampart; but, if it formerly formed part of the
outworks or outward defences of the castle, it probably has been
fortified with palisades or stakes.</p>
<p>The church and little village of Wigmore are close to the
castle.&nbsp; The church is a plain stone Gothic edifice, of
great antiquity.&nbsp; It contains sedilia, and also a piscina,
both of remarkable <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>construction: the former being literally stone seats
separated by stone partitions perfectly plain, without any
canopies or arches; and the latter being placed on the acute
angle of some masonry near them.&nbsp; The roof of the church is
of a very unusual description, as it is of massive oak timber,
waggon-shaped, and apparently of great age; and a large part of
the outside wall of the north side of the nave is built with the
stones set in the herringbone fashion, which is now very rarely
to be met with, and is usually considered a proof of its remote
antiquity.</p>
<p>A chapel, now demolished, originally stood on another part of
the north side of the church, as is proved by the piscina still
remaining on the outside of it; and the arch through which the
entrance was obtained into it from the church, being still
apparent in the north wall.</p>
<p>Considering the great utility of the castle, as a bridle to
incursions from the borders of Wales, formerly a hostile country,
its importance to the lords of the Welsh marches, and its having
been a residence of the powerful Mortimers, who had more than
once caused kings to feel uneasy on their thrones, I was a little
surprised not to find it of more extensive size; nor did I
consider its position to have been naturally as strong, as might
have been expected, for such a fortress.</p>
<p>Here the traveller finds himself in a district upon the
borders of Wales, which in a remote age, and when the
principality was considered as a hostile country, was a part of
the Welsh marches, and the personages in command there, were
designated Lords Marchers. <a name="citation78a"></a><a
href="#footnote78a" class="citation">[78a]</a>&nbsp; They were so
called, from the word <i>marche</i>, or limit.&nbsp; They had
Courts of Marche, in which they tried causes of different kinds,
and especially offences against the public peace, which went by
the name of Marche Treason. <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a>&nbsp; The <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Mortimers
often held that important office upon the borders of Wales.</p>
<p>There were in Wales, and the borders of England, adjoining the
principality, 141 manors, of large extent, possessed by the Lords
Marchers, who enjoyed almost regal rights upon their lands, and
administered justice within their several districts, without the
intervention of the King&rsquo;s judges. <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a>&nbsp; The excessive authority and
local jurisdictions of the Lords Marchers, in this debatable
land, were abolished by an act of Parliament, in the time of
Henry VIII. <a name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a></p>
<p>The drive from Leominster to Wigmore is interesting and
pleasant.&nbsp; The view from Wigmore Castle is extensive and
beautiful; an amphitheatre of mountains forms a background,
between which and the castle, is a very extensive plain, over
which, in days of yore, the powerful Mortimers could survey, from
the towers and battlements, their vast possessions, and, as
mighty feudal lords, they also could despotically command the
property, services, and even the lives of nearly all who resided
within the district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most sanguinary and important
battle that ever took place in the civil wars of England, was
that of Towton, in Yorkshire; and from the interest which it has
excited, and the historical events which have resulted from it, I
have been induced to pay several visits to that memorable field
of battle. <a name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Queen
Margaret <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> and the Lancastrians, exulting in the
victory obtained at Wakefield, were encouraged by it to proceed
towards London, in hopes of being admitted into the city; but on
their arrival at St. Alban&rsquo;s, they encountered the Earl of
Warwick <a name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> and an army of Yorkists; and for the
second time, within less than six years, a battle was fought
there. <a name="citation82c"></a><a href="#footnote82c"
class="citation">[82c]</a>&nbsp; It terminated in the defeat of
the Yorkists, and was of great importance to the Lancastrians,
because they regained the advantage of the use of the name of
King Henry VI. <a name="citation82d"></a><a href="#footnote82d"
class="citation">[82d]</a> in their proceedings, as the battle
delivered him out of the custody of the Yorkists.&nbsp;
Margaret&rsquo;s victory was, however, disgraced by an act of
great barbarity: she, or some of the Lancastrian leaders with her
sanction, put to death in cold blood, after the battle, Lord <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Bonvile, <a
name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a"
class="citation">[83a]</a> and Sir Thomas Kiriel <a
name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b"
class="citation">[83b]</a> of Kent, to whose custody King Henry
had been confided before the battle, and notwithstanding they had
remained with him on his express assurance of their safety.</p>
<p>Margaret, however, was very far from deriving the advantages
which she had hoped for, from the victory.&nbsp; The citizens of
London were, for the most part, favourable to the House of York;
besides which, they were alarmed at the outrages, rapine, and
violence, perpetrated by Margaret&rsquo;s lawless forces, on
their march towards London, and, consequently, its gates were
shut against her.&nbsp; Margaret found that she could not obtain
admission into the city, and received intelligence that the Earl
of Warwick had effected a junction with Edward Earl of March, <a
name="citation83c"></a><a href="#footnote83c"
class="citation">[83c]</a> at Chipping Norton, near Cotswold, and
that they were marching with all the forces that they could
collect, upon London; she, therefore, found it expedient to
retire with her army, and to proceed to the north of England, in
order to raise more forces; and then she hoped to have in the
field an army sufficiently strong to crush her antagonists
effectually.</p>
<p>Edward entered London triumphant after his victory at
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross; and having the support of Thomas
Bourchier, <a name="citation83d"></a><a href="#footnote83d"
class="citation">[83d]</a> Archbishop of Canterbury; George
Neville, <a name="citation83e"></a><a href="#footnote83e"
class="citation">[83e]</a> Bishop of Exeter, <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and Lord
Chancellor; and other bishops; the Duke of Norfolk; <a
name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a> the Earl of Warwick; Lord Falconberg;
<a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a> and other noblemen and knights of the
Yorkist party, who were then in London; was declared King by
acclamation, by a large body of troops and of spectators, in the
fields near Clerkenwell, on the 2nd of March, 1461. <a
name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c"
class="citation">[84c]</a>&nbsp; On the 3rd he was petitioned by
the noblemen and leaders of that party, to assume the kingly
office, and rode on the 4th to St. Paul&rsquo;s, and there made
his offering, and then proceeded with a pompous procession to
Westminster Hall, and took his seat upon the throne, with the
sceptre in his hand, and was recognised as King, somewhat in the
form of a coronation.&nbsp; From thence he went with a similar
procession to Westminster Abbey, under a canopy, and, having made
another offering there, he received the homage of the noblemen
there present, and was afterwards, in the usual form, proclaimed
King of England, in Westminster, by the title of Edward IV., and
the next day was proclaimed in the same manner, in the city of
London.&nbsp; The 4th of March was the day on which Henry VI. was
subsequently declared by Parliament to have been deposed, <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and the reign
of Edward IV. to have commenced. <a name="citation85a"></a><a
href="#footnote85a" class="citation">[85a]</a>&nbsp;
Edward&rsquo;s great object now was to seek and encounter the
Lancastrian army; he had nothing to gain by delay, but everything
to hope from a victory, which he knew would remove the advantage
which Henry VI. had, from his being in possession of the crown,
and having been for so many years recognised by the nation as
King of England.&nbsp; On the 7th of March the Earl of Warwick,
and a large portion of the army of the Yorkists, quitted London,
and commenced their march towards the North.&nbsp; On the 12th,
Edward and the remainder of the army also left London, and
proceeded with little rest, until they reached Pontefract.</p>
<p>The Lancastrian army had assembled at York, and on the
approach of the Yorkists, quitted the city, and marched through
Tadcaster to Towton, and there prepared for the approach of their
enemies; whilst King Henry VI., Queen Margaret, and Edward <a
name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a> the young Prince of Wales, remained at
York, awaiting the result of the impending battle, which was to
decide whether Henry was to continue to be the sovereign of
England, or to become a poor exile and a homeless fugitive.</p>
<p>It was with feelings of the most intense hatred, that the
forces of the two parties approached each other; the deaths of
not a few of the members of their respective families, and of
many friends in battle, and of others on the scaffold, the
forfeitures and confiscations by the act of attainder of the
Parliament held at Coventry, and the bitterness of party strife,
gave to the conflict a degree of inveteracy and fury, perhaps
never equalled in any civil dissensions in England; and it cannot
excite wonder, that in the dreadful battle which ensued, no
quarter was given or expected.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>The
first hostile meeting of any of the forces, was unfavourable to
the cause of Edward.&nbsp; He had sent troops commanded by Lord
Fitzwalter, <a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a> to secure the passage over the river
Aire, at Ferrybridge; but in the course of the night of the 27th
of March, or very early in the morning of the 28th, a body of
light cavalry, under the command of Lord Clifford, <a
name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a> was detached by the Lancastrians, and
attacked and defeated the Yorkists stationed there, slew their
leader, and won that position; but in consequence of
Edward&rsquo;s forces having crossed the Aire at Castleford,
three miles higher up the river, the Lancastrian troops were soon
obliged to retreat from Ferrybridge, and, in endeavouring to
rejoin the main body at Towton, were intercepted at a place
called Dintingdale, <a name="citation86c"></a><a
href="#footnote86c" class="citation">[86c]</a> near
Scarthingwell, and near Saxton, were completely defeated, and
their leader, Lord Clifford, was slain.</p>
<p>The main bodies of the two armies were now close to each
other: that of the Yorkists being posted at Saxton, and that of
the Lancastrians at Towton; and during the night of the 28th,
each party prepared for the terrible combat of the morrow.&nbsp;
On Palm Sunday, the 29th of March, 1461, at nine in the morning,
the battle commenced; and it is to be regretted, that the old
historians have handed down to us, very little information of
value, respecting that most extraordinary and sanguinary
conflict; but some of the few particulars which they have left,
will be noticed afterwards.&nbsp; The battle is said to have
raged with great obstinacy and valour on both sides, during about
ten hours, and terminated in a complete victory on the side of
the Yorkists, and the rout and dispersion of the Lancastrian
army.</p>
<p>The place where it was fought, is found without difficulty;
indeed the old chroniclers and annalists mention the locality <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>with
sufficient precision.&nbsp; We know from those sources
(independently of tradition), that it took place near Towton,
partly in the township of Towton, and partly in that of Saxton,
<a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> and between Towton and Saxton and as
the distances between the villages of those names, is only one
mile and a half, it defines the exact locality very clearly.</p>
<p>The battle has been called by various names, such as the
battle of &ldquo;Towton,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Saxton,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Palm Sunday Field,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sherburn,&rdquo; and
in the act of attainder of the first of Edward IV. it is called
&ldquo;Saxtonfeld and Tawtonfeeld, in the shire of York.&rdquo;
<a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b"
class="citation">[87b]</a></p>
<p>This celebrated and decisive battle established for a
considerable time, Edward IV. upon the throne of England. <a
name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c"
class="citation">[87c]</a></p>
<p>The place where it was fought, lies between the villages of
Saxton and Towton, and very near to, but a little to the
southward of, the latter village.&nbsp; In order that the
locality may be correctly understood, it is necessary to mention,
that the district in which the battle was fought consists of an
extensive range of high land, the approach to which, on the south
side, is by a gentle ascent, which commences about a quarter of a
mile on the north side of the village of Saxton, and extends as a
small elevated plain (except in one spot, where there is a
depression or valley, which will be afterwards described), past
the village of Towton, by the modern turnpike road, until within
about a mile from Tadcaster, where the road descends rather
rapidly into a flat tract of meadow ground, extending to
Tadcaster.&nbsp; On the eastward, the high ground slopes gently
down towards the present great north road, leading from
Ferrybridge to Tadcaster; and the slope of the land continues
inclining to the eastward, in the direction of North Milford and
of Church Fenton; and the <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>south-eastward extremity extends
towards Scarthingwell.&nbsp; On the west side, the high ground
terminates very abruptly in steep eminences, some parts of which
may, from their steepness and abruptness, without much
impropriety, be called cliffs, which overlook a narrow belt of
beautiful meadow ground, in which the river Cock, there called
Cock-Beck, flows.&nbsp; It runs towards the north; and after
passing the spot which will be afterwards more particularly
noticed, where the ancient road to Tadcaster formerly was, it
makes a turn towards the eastward, and at the foot of the descent
before mentioned, the modern turnpike road (the present great
north road) crosses it; and it flows from thence across some
meadows for about a quarter of a mile, still to the eastward, and
there runs into the river Wharfe.&nbsp; The ancient road, upon
which men yet living have driven to and from Tadcaster, which is
now little more than an occupation road, turns off abruptly, at
the north end of, and close to, Towton village, and descends the
eminence <a name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a> in a westwardly direction, to a
continuation of the belt of meadow ground before mentioned, where
it arrives at the river Cock.&nbsp; This descent by the ancient
road is so steep, that it is a matter of surprise, how the heavy
coaches formerly in use, and waggons, could safely pass up and
down it, yet it was even in modern times part of the great north
road.&nbsp; After descending the eminence, the ancient road
formerly crossed the river Cock by a stone bridge, now destroyed;
<a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a> and after passing over a part of the
beautiful meadow ground before noticed, it ascended the rising
ground on the opposite side of the meadow, and so proceeded on
towards Tadcaster.</p>
<p>At present, the river Cock is crossed in the meadow by a
narrow wooden bridge, merely used for foot passengers and horses,
the supporting piers of which are of stone, and they <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>probably were
built or rebuilt from the materials of the older bridge; in fact,
I saw several worked and broken stones lying near it,
strengthening the supposition of their having formed part of an
old bridge.&nbsp; It may be correct here to mention that there is
an old stone bridge at the village of Stutton, still existing,
also over the Cock, much nearer to Tadcaster, from which a road
joins the old road before mentioned to Tadcaster, and that human
bones, probably of some of the fugitives, have been dug up on the
line of the country where the modern turnpike road runs between
Towton village and the bridge at Stutton. <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a></p>
<p>The village of Towton is small, and not well built; the houses
are principally of stone, or with rough-cast fronts; it has not
any church; and Towton Hall, where John Kendall, Esq., resides,
is close to the village on the south-westward side of it.&nbsp;
The village lies about two miles and a half to the southward of
Tadcaster; and the turnpike road from Ferrybridge towards
Tadcaster, passes through Sherburn and past Barkston and
Scarthingwell Park, and proceeds directly to it (Towton and
Sherburn being nearly north and south of each other); and the
turnpike road passes through the village of Towton, at which it
meets the public road which will be afterwards noticed, from the
village of Saxton.</p>
<p>There is also a road leading from Saxton village to
Scarthingwell which joins the turnpike road from Ferrybridge, at
Dintingdale, <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>at the distance of about half a mile from Saxton
village; and on the eastward side of the Ferrybridge road, there
is a stone quarry called Dintingdale Quarry, close to the place
where the other road joins it.</p>
<p>Near this spot at Dintingdale, the engagement took place, in
which the savage Lancastrian leader, Lord Clifford, fell, <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> on the 28th of March, the day before
the battle of Towton; <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a> his crimes merited
a worse fate.&nbsp; His death is introduced by Shakespeare in the
<i>Third Part of King Henry VI.</i></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">(<i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Clifford</span> <i>wounded</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Clifford</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Here burns my candle out, ay,
here it dies,<br />
Which, whilst it lasted, gave King Henry light.<br />
Ah, Lancaster! I fear thine overthrow,<br />
More than my body&rsquo;s parting with my soul.<br />
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;<br />
And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melt,<br />
Impairing Henry, strength&rsquo;ning misproud York.&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * * * * * *<br />
* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;<br />
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:<br />
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;<br />
For at their hands I have deserv&rsquo;d no pity.<br />
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,<br />
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elevated land begins to rise about a quarter of a mile on
the north side of Saxton village, from which a public road
proceeds from thence in a northwardly direction, and continues to
rise until within little more than half a mile to the southward
of the village of Towton, where there is a considerable
depression or descent in the road, and in the ground on each side
of it.&nbsp; At this place, and on the left or westward of the
road, the depression in the ground deepens through a large
meadow, where it forms a valley, which contracts, and extends
through <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>an
opening in the eminence or cliff before mentioned, to the belt of
meadow land extending to the river Cock.&nbsp; On the right or
eastward side of the public road, the depression which is called
Towton Dale, extends some little distance into the adjoining
fields, and then becomes a mere undulation in the fields; and the
ground is nearly level from thence towards the eastward.&nbsp;
This place is easily known&mdash;not merely by the large meadow
and valley, but by a stone quarry called Towton Dale Quarry,
worked close to, and on the westward or left side of, the road,
and which is passed on leaving the depression, and ascending
towards Towton village. <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>Those marks will enable the visitor to find the scene of
action, without difficulty.&nbsp; The battle of Towton was fought
on the spot now occupied by the large meadow and valley before
mentioned (on the west side of the road), the depression called
Towton Dale, the fields extending a considerable distance to the
eastward of the road, and the ground in the neighbourhood of the
stone quarry.</p>
<p>The large meadow is remarkable for producing rich rank grass,
and also for three or four extensive irregularly shaped patches
of very small wild dwarf rose-bushes, which I was told, were both
red and white; it forms the west end of Towton Dale.&nbsp; The
meadow is not unfrequently called the Bloody Meadow, and was,
according to tradition, a scene of great slaughter, and it is
said that considerable numbers of the dead were buried
there.&nbsp; The distance across the fields, from the public road
at that spot to the turnpike road leading from Ferrybridge, is
about a mile, and the whole tract of ground between them is
enclosed and cultivated.</p>
<p>The Lancastrians had their army drawn up, a little to the
southward of the village of Towton, which was rather more than <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>a quarter of
a mile in their rear, and they occupied the highest ground
there.&nbsp; The position was a good one.&nbsp; Their right wing
extended towards the eminence or cliff before mentioned, and they
had the meadow and valley in front of it.&nbsp; Their centre had
the depression called Towton Dale, or at least part of it, in
front, and their left wing extended a considerable distance to
the eastward, <a name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a"
class="citation">[92a]</a> towards the place where the turnpike
road from Ferrybridge now is.&nbsp; Before the land was drained,
which lies below and on the eastward side of the Ferrybridge
road, between Dintingdale and Towton, some boggy and marshy land
formerly existed beyond the position of their left wing, which
perhaps might be a protection against its being outflanked. <a
name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a>&nbsp; Their left wing had no
particular advantage over their adversaries, except from the
ground being a trifle, and not much, higher than that occupied by
the right of the latter.&nbsp; The Lancastrian position extended
along the highest part of the ground, in a direction almost due
east and west.</p>
<p>The Yorkists naturally drew up their army opposite the other,
and on the south side of the meadow and depression before
mentioned, and with their centre and right wing extending across
the ground, now enclosed fields, to the eastward, and towards the
present turnpike road from Ferrybridge.</p>
<p>I made inquiries from persons residing near the scene of
action, but could not learn that there were any traces of
intrenchments visible: although they might have been expected <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to have been
found at the spot where the Lancastrians were posted.</p>
<p>Instances have occurred, though not very numerous of late, of
the discovery of parts of human skeletons, and fragments of
armour, weapons, piles of arrows, bridle-bits, spurs, &amp;c.
&amp;c., on the field of battle.</p>
<p>The remains of armour, weapons, and other relics, turned up on
the field of this great engagement, have been comparatively,
rather small, which has been very fairly accounted for by Dr.
Whitaker, <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> from the circumstance, that the weather
was cold, and the victory complete, so that the spoil of the
field, and the interment of the dead, proceeded at leisure; he,
however, mentions one relic, which escaped the vigilance of
plunder, viz., a gold ring, weighing about one ounce, which was
found on the field about thirty years before (his work was
published in 1816); it had no stone, but a lion passant was cut
upon the gold, with this inscription in the old black-letter
character&mdash;&ldquo;Now ys thus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The crest is
that of the Percies; and Dr. Whitaker considers, that it was a
ring actually worn by the Earl of Northumberland; and that the
motto seems to allude to the times; as if it were expressed,
&ldquo;This age is fierce as a lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drake, in his <i>Eboracum</i>, says, that about a year or two
before he wrote (his work was published in 1736), he and two
other gentlemen had the curiosity to go and see a fresh grave
opened, in those fields, where, amongst vast quantities of bones,
they found some arrow piles, pieces of broken swords, and five
very fresh groat pieces of Henry IV., V., and VI.&rsquo;s
coin.&nbsp; These were laid near together, close to a thighbone,
which made them conjecture, that there had not been time to strip
the dead, before they were tossed into the pit.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, that he has not informed us, in what
particular spot, those relics were dug up; but as he, in the <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>preceding
sentence, had mentioned the intended chapel, and the piece of
ground called &ldquo;Chapel Garth,&rdquo; it is only reasonable
to conclude, that he alluded to the latter.</p>
<p>In the month of August 1774, a man was living at Saxton who,
with many others, had been concerned in opening some graves of
the warriors, slain at the battle of Towton, to satisfy the
curiosity of some gentlemen.&nbsp; On a strict examination of the
bones, then found, it appeared, that the least decayed, were the
<i>internodia digitorum</i>, of the bones of the thumbs and
fingers. <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Whitaker informs us, that he was possessed of a silver
ring, gilt, with two hands conjoined engraved upon it, which was
found upon the field of battle. <a name="citation94b"></a><a
href="#footnote94b" class="citation">[94b]</a></p>
<p>A dagger or short sword, discovered there, is now in the
possession of the Rev. William Jepson Newman, of Badsworth,
Yorkshire; it is 2 feet 4&frac12; inches long, including the
portion which was formerly inserted in the handle; very narrow,
being at the broadest part hardly more than half an inch in
breadth, but thick in proportion, and angular.&nbsp; It has been
somewhat shortened at the point, which is at present round; and
it was picked up by the father of a man who now resides in the
neighbouring township of Lotherton. <a name="citation94c"></a><a
href="#footnote94c" class="citation">[94c]</a></p>
<p>A spear-head, or pike-head, was six or seven years ago amongst
some old iron in a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, near the field of
battle, which had been found on the field; it was purchased and
taken away by a gentleman. <a name="citation94c"></a><a
href="#footnote94c" class="citation">[94c]</a></p>
<p>There is another curious relic of the battle, which has been
preserved.&nbsp; A battle-axe, of which the blade is of a small
size; <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and
the handle is perfect, of black oak, roughly made, and 2&frac12;
inches in the gripe.&nbsp; The blade and handle of the axe, are
together, about 18 inches long.&nbsp; Its history is
curious.&nbsp; It was found very many years ago, in the bed of
the river Cock.&nbsp; It was purchased by Colonel Grant, R.A., at
Saxton, from the wife of a miller there; and she informed him,
that it had been preserved for a long period of time in the
family of her husband.&nbsp; She had been in the habit of using
it for the purpose of breaking sugar: an extraordinary change in
the use of a weapon, which, as we cannot doubt, had been wielded
at the battle of Towton, by a Lancastrian warrior, and been lost
in the river Cock, in his flight from Towton Field.&nbsp; It
remained a considerable time in the possession of Colonel Grant,
and was presented by him, to the Duke of Northumberland, for his
museum at Alnwick Castle, where it still is. <a

class="citation">[95a]</a></p>
<p>A spur, which I have seen, of brass gilt, found on the field
of battle, is preserved in the Museum of the Society of
Antiquaries of London; it is a rowel spur; the rowel is scarcely
larger than that of a modern spur, in which respect it differs
from the very large rowels, of that period, which have
occasionally been discovered.&nbsp; The spur is remarkably
perfect, and is slightly ornamented with a kind of scroll
pattern.&nbsp; Upon the shanks is engraved, in Old English
characters, the following inscription&mdash;&ldquo;en loial
amour, tout mon coer;&rdquo; the style and engraving of which,
indicate its being of about the period of the battle. <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a></p>
<p>I also learnt, on my visit to Towton Field in 1854, that on
the recent occasion of making excavations for the York and North
Midland Railway, close to Towton, some human bones were
discovered; the spot was near the old road before described, and
in the line of the retreat of the Lancastrians, from the field of
battle, towards Tadcaster.</p>
<p>It is said that human bones, which must be presumed to have <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>been those of
some of the fugitive Lancastrians, have been found in the line of
country, leading from Towton village towards the village of
Stutton, at which a part of the fugitive Lancastrians probably
crossed the river Cock, in their flight towards Tadcaster.</p>
<p>Persons residing near the field of battle, readily point out
the place, where Lord Dacre <a name="citation96"></a><a
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a> is said to have been
slain, and which I have several times made a point of visiting,
in the course of my rambles there; it is in a field called Nor
Acres (or North Acre), which seems to have been originally much
larger, and to have been subdivided.&nbsp; It belongs to Lord
Hawke, and lies a couple of fields&rsquo; breadth to the eastward
of the public road, and opposite the large meadow before noticed,
and extends a considerable distance to the eastward.&nbsp; Dr.
Whitaker states, that when Glover made his visitation in 1583, he
heard the tradition, that Lord Dacre was shot at Towton Field, by
a boy <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;out of a burtree,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
place where he was slayne is called the North Acres, whereupon
they have this rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lord of Dacres<br />
was slayne in the North Acres.&rdquo; <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable that the farmer who occupies the field, and
others whom I conversed with, repeated the tradition, and told me
that Lord Dacre was slain by an arrow shot by a boy from an
auberry-tree, evidently meaning the same shrub as that called
burtree by Dr. Whitaker, who states that he did not know what the
burtree was.&nbsp; I was quite satisfied that the word auberry,
was a provincial name for the elder-tree, and requested a person
near the spot, to point out such a tree to me, and, as I
anticipated, I was shown the elder-tree.</p>
<p>Following the depression or valley before mentioned, to the
eastward, and at the corner of the second field from the public
road, there was, until within about the last twelve or thirteen
years, a square space, enclosed with an embankment, containing
about half an acre; it was not usually ploughed, but in grass;
and was said to have been a place of interment of many of the
corpses after the battle; it lay on the corner of the Nor Acres
(or North Acre) Field, at the southward; but the embankment is
now thrown down, and the land has been ploughed.&nbsp; According
to tradition, the greatest slaughter took place at or near the
Nor Acres Field.</p>
<p>Great numbers of the slain were interred in Saxton Churchyard,
in a large trench or pit on the north side of the church.&nbsp;
Their bones were exposed to view, lying about four feet below the
surface, in making a vault not many years ago, and again,
subsequently, in making another, in 1848, as will be noticed in
another place; we may conclude that they were the bones of
Yorkists of some consideration, from the circumstance of the
survivors taking the trouble of interring the remains in
consecrated ground, at some little distance from the field of the
battle.&nbsp; The persons whose bones were so exposed, must have
been <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>either young, or in the prime of life, because the
skulls were remarkable for the soundness and excellence of the
teeth.</p>
<p>Amongst other fields on the spot where the battle was fought,
there is one of considerable extent, lying on the eastward side,
to which, or near to which, the Lancastrian left wing extended,
which fronts the west side of the turnpike road from Ferrybridge;
any person desirous of walking over the field of battle from the
Ferrybridge road, will do well to cross it from this part, and
enter the large field which is nearly opposite a white farmhouse,
standing on the eastward side of the Ferrybridge road.&nbsp; On
one occasion, whilst I was in it, I met with a farmer there, who
informed me that some few relics of the battle had been
discovered, but very rarely near the place.&nbsp; I have also
obtained considerable information from several other persons
residing near the field of battle. <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Whitaker states <a name="citation98b"></a><a
href="#footnote98b" class="citation">[98b]</a> that &ldquo;the
field of battle is scarcely more than a mile long, and with
little level ground in front of both armies, declines in the rear
of both.&nbsp; Hence it appears, that as the line could scarcely
exceed 3000 men, the files must have been very deep, and that the
rear must have been perpetually advancing as the front lines
fell.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that theory of Dr. Whitaker appears to
proceed upon the assumption that each of the armies would be
drawn up in only one body.&nbsp; At that period, the men-at-arms,
or heavy cavalry, went to battle in complete armour; each man
carried a lance, sword, dagger, and occasionally a mace, or
battle-axe; his horse also was, to a certain extent, in
armour.&nbsp; A considerable part of the infantry of <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>an English
army, consisted of archers, armed with long bows, and arrows; and
another large part consisted of men armed with bills, pikes,
pole-axes, glaives, and morris-pikes.&nbsp; Such of the forces as
were of the latter description, would probably be drawn up in
deep files, the better to resist charges of horse, but the
archers and cavalry, in order to be useful, would require more
space, and would be drawn up with more extended fronts. <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a></p>
<p>It is, however, certain that each army was drawn up in more
than one body; the rearmost body being in the nature of a
<i>corps de reserve</i>; and in that case, of course, the army
would present a much more contracted front.&nbsp; We may fairly
conclude, that the Lancastrians must have been drawn up in at
least two bodies or lines, with the foot in rather deep files,
and that their left wing extended to, or very near to, the place
where the present turnpike road from Ferrybridge runs.&nbsp; The
old historians inform us, that the Earl of Northumberland <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a> and Sir Andrew Trollop <a
name="citation99c"></a><a href="#footnote99c"
class="citation">[99c]</a> commanded the van of the Lancastrians,
which implies that there must have been a rear body, or force
commanded by other leaders.&nbsp; The van of the Yorkists was
commanded by <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Lord Falconberg, and the rearward by Sir John Wenlock
<a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> and Sir John Dinham or Denham; <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> and it is certain, that such
enterprising and courageous personages as Edward IV. and the Earl
of Warwick, would take a prominent part in the battle, and would
not willingly remain in the rear; accordingly they are said to
have commanded the main body.</p>
<p>Near the village of Towton, and on its south-west side, King
Richard III. commenced building a chapel, in memory of the slain
who had fallen in the battle, but it never was finished; <a
name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c"
class="citation">[100c]</a> and the place where it was commenced
is now called the <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;Chapel Garth,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chapel
Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is situated close to, and extends in the
rear or westward of, Towton Hall, which stands on part of the
site of it; and a considerable mass of human bones was found,
about sixty years ago, in enlarging the cellars at Towton Hall.
<a name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a>&nbsp; Behind the garden, and on the
west side, are some inequalities in the ground, seemingly
denoting the site of a small building; and in digging there,
tiles and worked stones have been discovered: strongly conveying
the impression, that the walls and foundations of the chapel had
been placed there.&nbsp; In some alterations which were formerly
made, in an old chimney in Towton Hall, there was found some
stone-work, broken, and evidently brought from elsewhere (and
used with other building materials), which had apparently formed
part of the mullions or tracery of a window, of an ecclesiastical
edifice, <a name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a> which may reasonably be supposed to
have been the chapel alluded to.</p>
<p>It is worthy of notice, that the spot was within the line
occupied by the Lancastrians, but probably, many of the slain on
both sides were interred there.</p>
<p>It cannot admit of a doubt, that the meadow and valley before
mentioned, and many parts of the meadows lying between the foot
of the declivities from the north side of the village of Towton,
and the banks of the river Cock, must contain the remains of
great numbers of the dead; but in most parts of the field where
the battle actually raged, the soil is not in general, deep, and
therefore, some parts of it would not easily admit of the
interment of the dead in large pits.</p>
<p>We learn from the old historical accounts, that the
Lancastrians mustered for this dreadful conflict about 60,000
men, and the Yorkists about 48,660.&nbsp; The battle is stated to
have commenced at nine in the morning, in the midst of a storm of
snow and sleet, and to have lasted until seven in the evening. <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a>&nbsp; It <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>was a battle of extermination: the
dreadful order not to give any quarter, nor to take any
prisoners, having been issued before its commencement by Edward
IV., and responded to by a similar order, on the part of the
Lancastrians.</p>
<p>When the Lancastrians began to give way, they at first retired
in the direction of Tadcaster, in some order, and made several
stands to keep their pursuers at bay; but they could not long
continue retreating without disorder; and in attempting to cross
the river Cock in haste, a dreadful scene of destruction took
place there, and such numbers of them were drowned, or otherwise
lost their lives in the bed of the stream, as to fill it, so that
the survivors passed it on the dead bodies of the sufferers.</p>
<p>The number of the slain is given by the chroniclers, as
36,776, but which probably includes not only all who fell on both
sides in the battle, but all who were slain in the pursuit, or
were drowned in the river Cock, and also all who fell in the
engagements at Ferrybridge and Dintingdale on the previous
day.</p>
<p>The principal leaders of the two parties, at the battle of
Towton, were, on the Yorkists&rsquo; side, the new King, Edward
IV.; the Duke of Norfolk (who was intended to have been the
principal commander at the battle, but was prevented by illness
from taking an active part in it; his forces, however, were
there, <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>and fought for Edward); the Earl of Warwick; his uncle,
Lord Falconberg; Sir John Wenlock; Sir John Denham; and a number
of the nobles and gentry of the midland and southern districts of
England: on the Lancastrian side, the Earl of Northumberland; the
Duke of Exeter; <a name="citation103a"></a><a

href="#footnote111d" class="citation">[111d]</a></p>
<p>There are several interesting particulars to be observed, on
an inspection of the field of battle and its vicinity, and a
visit to the river Cock, which tend very much to corroborate the
old historical accounts.&nbsp; We learn, that at first the
Lancastrians retired from the field in some order, but soon
became disordered, and retreated in great confusion.&nbsp; It is
easy to believe, that with the ground then unenclosed, or only
partially enclosed, near Towton, they would at first retire in
tolerable order, until they had passed the village; but when they
turned off to the left, or westward, immediately upon leaving the
village, and descended towards the river Cock, by the ancient and
steep road, as they seem to have done, great confusion would most
probably ensue in the retreat of an undisciplined army.&nbsp;
Their right wing, in retiring, would naturally fall back by the
ground where Towton Hall now stands, or a little to the westward
of it; but immediately after passing the village, it is almost
certain that they would find their centre and right wing meeting
nearly at one <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>point, and all pressing forward to descend towards the
river Cock.&nbsp; The steep descent from the village by the old
road, must have been very perilous, under such circumstances;
their cavalry, many of the horses doubtless wounded and
ungovernable, and their infantry, all attempting to descend by a
steep road, hotly pursued by enemies, who gave no quarter, would
probably soon become a disorderly mass of fugitives, and when
they attempted to cross the Cock, nearly all order would be lost,
and a scene of confusion and carnage would naturally
result.&nbsp; The strong probability is, that there was not then
any bridge over the Cock; but if there were one, we must conclude
that it was of small size, and that it could not have been wide
enough to allow so numerous a crowd to pass; and if there were
not one, and all of them were obliged to attempt to ford the
stream, the danger would of course be increased.&nbsp; The river
Cock is narrower than the general width of our inland canal
navigations, and when I visited it in the summers of several
years, I could have waded across it, without having the water
much above my knees; but I can easily suppose that at the close
of winter, and when fed with melted snow, it would be difficult,
if not dangerous, to ford it.</p>
<p>There is a passage in Biondi&rsquo;s work, upon the wars of
the Houses of York and Lancaster, written in old Italian, which
tends to confirm the idea that there was not, at the period of
the battle, any bridge there, but that the river was usually
forded; the passage, however, is not conclusive, because, whether
there was a bridge or not, a vast number of the fugitives would
naturally attempt to ford the little river. <a
name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those who remained alive, took the road for
the bridge of Tadcaster, but being unable to reach it, and
believing a small <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>river called Cock to be fordable, the greater part were
drowned therein.&nbsp; It is constantly affirmed, that those who
survived, passed over, by treading on the dead bodies of the
sufferers; the water of this stream, and of the river Wharfe,
into which it empties itself, were coloured in a manner to appear
as pure blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have several times descended to and visited the river Cock,
in two places&mdash;one after passing through the large meadow
and valley before mentioned, and the other after descending from
the village of Towton, by the old road already described; and
whilst I drank of its pure and cool waters, at each place, I
could not avoid reflecting upon the lamentable fact, that after
the battle, this interesting stream flowed stained with human
gore; and that both the Cock, and the large river the Wharfe,
into which it flows, were discoloured with it, so as to appear
like rivers of blood.&nbsp; Doubtless very much of that shocking
discoloration was produced both by the wounded, in their
endeavours to cross the Cock, and by the men slain in its bed or
on its banks, in their flight; besides which, a portion of the
field of battle near the public road dips towards the westward,
and the melted snow mixed with blood would naturally drain
through the large meadow and valley before mentioned, towards the
Cock; and we learn from history, that the blood of the slain lay
caked with the snow, which at that time covered the face of the
ground, and afterwards dissolving with it, ran down in a most
horrible manner the furrows and ditches of the fields, for two or
three miles together. <a name="citation113"></a><a
href="#footnote113" class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<p>However well selected the position of the Lancastrians was for
fighting a battle, it was a most dangerous one for defeated
forces to retreat from, because the contiguity of the river
Wharfe, which was only from two to three miles distant on the
eastward and north-eastward, prevented their escape from the
field in that direction, and the eminence or cliff prevented it
on the westward; whilst towards the northward the declivities and
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>river
Cock in their rear, were almost certain to cause, to an
undisciplined army, the disorganization and loss of life which
ensued.</p>
<p>There is a point of some historical moment connected with the
action at Dintingdale which is worth notice.&nbsp; Edward IV. was
at Pontefract on the 27th of March, and prepared to pass the Aire
at Ferrybridge, or both at that place and at Castleford.&nbsp;
Lord Clifford, with a body of light cavalry under his command, <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> left the main army of Lancastrians,
either on the night of the 27th, or sufficiently early on the
morning of the 28th, to surprise and defeat the body of Yorkists
posted under the command of Lord Fitzwalter <a
name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a> at Ferrybridge, at daybreak; and <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Lord
Fitzwalter, unaware of the approach of the enemy, hearing a
disturbance and uproar, went from his bed armed only with a
poleaxe, and lost his life <a name="citation115a"></a><a
href="#footnote115a" class="citation">[115a]</a> in the
conflict.&nbsp; The Yorkists then passed the Aire at Castleford
(only three miles distant) in great force, in hopes of cutting
off the troops under Lord Clifford, who then retreated from
Ferrybridge; and the Yorkists either intercepted or overtook him,
slew him, and defeated and destroyed nearly all his forces, at
Dintingdale.&nbsp; As Dintingdale is only one mile and a half
from Towton, and little more than half a mile from Saxton, the
Yorkists would never have hazarded an action with so large a body
of cavalry as we must suppose that Lord Clifford had with him, in
a place so close to the main army of the Lancastrians, unless the
Yorkists were in great force there, or were within reach of
certain support from their advancing main army.&nbsp; From those
circumstances, and from the fact of the distance from Castleford
to Saxton being but short, it appears very probable that by the
middle or early in the afternoon of the 28th, the Yorkists had
advanced to the village of Saxton, and perhaps to Dintingdale,
and occupied the neighbourhood of those places in considerable
force.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitaker states <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a> that Lord
Clifford, according to the tradition of the family, was tumbled
into a pit, with a promiscuous heap of dead bodies.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>From
the appearance of the road and the neighbouring country, it seems
almost certain that, in 1461, the great north road from
Ferrybridge to Tadcaster, turned off from the present Ferrybridge
road, <a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a> and passed through the village of
Saxton, and then proceeded by the public road before mentioned
through Towton; and if so, when the Yorkists advanced towards
Towton, they would find the Lancastrian army lying like a lion in
their path.</p>
<p>It is well known, that cannons and other firearms were used in
the wars of York and Lancaster; and there is not any reason to
doubt that they were used at the battle of Towton; yet it is
remarkable that the fact is not noticed by any ancient
writer.&nbsp; Guns of some kind or other, appear to have been
used in the following instances in the field (exclusive of
sieges) during those wars: viz., in 1455, at the first battle of
St. Alban&rsquo;s; <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a> in 1459, at the
encampment of the Yorkists at Ludford in Herefordshire; <a
name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b"
class="citation">[116b]</a> in 1460, at the battle of
Northampton; <a name="citation116c"></a><a href="#footnote116c"
class="citation">[116c]</a> in 1469, at the battle near
Hornfield, Lincolnshire, often called the Battle of Lose Coat
Field; <a name="citation116d"></a><a href="#footnote116d"
class="citation">[116d]</a> in 1471, on the landing of Edward IV.
at Ravenspur; <a name="citation116e"></a><a href="#footnote116e"
class="citation">[116e]</a> in 1471, at the battle of Barnet; <a
name="citation116f"></a><a href="#footnote116f"
class="citation">[116f]</a> again in 1471, at the battle of
Tewkesbury; <a name="citation116g"></a><a href="#footnote116g"
class="citation">[116g]</a> in 1485, at the battle of Bosworth;
<a name="citation116h"></a><a href="#footnote116h"
class="citation">[116h]</a> and in 1487, at the battle of Stoke.
<a name="citation116i"></a><a href="#footnote116i"
class="citation">[116i]</a>&nbsp; It can scarcely excite
surprise, at the chroniclers and annalists not having mentioned
cannons, as having been used at the battle of Towton, when it is
borne in mind, that they do not make the slightest mention of
cavalry having been employed there; although it is certain, that
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>in both
armies there must have been large bodies of cavalry engaged at
that battle.</p>
<p>The honour of bearing Edward IV.&rsquo;s standard, of the
Black Bull, at the battle of Towton, devolved upon Ralph
Vestynden, afterwards one of the yeomen of the chamber, who had
for his services, at the battle, an annuity of &pound;10, granted
to him &ldquo;yerely unto the tyme he be rewarded by us of an
office.&rdquo; <a name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a"
class="citation">[117a]</a>&nbsp; Besides having been borne upon
Edward&rsquo;s standard at that battle, &ldquo;the Bull sable,
corned and hoofed, or,&rdquo; was also used on other occasions by
Edward IV., and others of the House of York, in consequence of
its having been a cognizance or device of the Clares (Earls of
Gloucester), from whom the House of York was descended. <a
name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b"
class="citation">[117b]</a></p>
<p>Henry VI., Queen Margaret, and Edward Prince of Wales, were at
York during the battle of Towton; and on hearing <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>of its
disastrous result, they fled northward with the Duke of Exeter,
the Duke of Somerset, Lord Roos, and Lord Hungerford, <a
name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a> and at first repaired to Berwick, and
from thence to Scotland, where Henry purchased the protection and
assistance of the King of Scotland, by the surrender of
Berwick.&nbsp; Edward IV. was received on the day after the
battle into York, with processions and great solemnity, the mayor
and commonalty having sued for grace, and having obtained it from
the King, through the mediation <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a> of Lord Montague
<a name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c"
class="citation">[118c]</a> and Lord Berners. <a
name="citation118d"></a><a href="#footnote118d"
class="citation">[118d]</a></p>
<p>King Edward, on hearing of the flight of Henry VI., and the
other personages, northward, immediately despatched a body of
light cavalry, in pursuit of them, but too late to overtake
them.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>Edward remained at York sufficiently long to celebrate
the festival of Easter there, and then went to Durham, and, after
taking measures for the pacification of the northern parts,
proceeded to London.</p>
<p>The decisive victory gained by Edward at Towton, confirmed his
previous assumption of the royal title; he became to all intents
the King of England; he was crowned at Westminster, on the 29th
of June; and his right to the throne was solemnly recognized by
the Parliament, which was held in the month of November
following.&nbsp; He was evidently a man of extraordinary talents,
enterprise, and courage; he had already fought and been the
conqueror in three important battles; and, notwithstanding the
serious and numerous obstacles which he had to overcome, he
succeeded in obtaining the sovereignty of England before he was
twenty years old: his birth having taken place at Rouen, in
Normandy, on the 29th of April, 1441. <a
name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a></p>
<p>There are some passages in the accounts of the battle, given
by historians, which seem to be exaggerated, or, at least, must
be received with some degree of allowance.&nbsp; We know from the
old historical writers, that the battle commenced in a fall of
snow or sleet, which was driven by the wind into the faces of the
Lancastrians.&nbsp; We are told that Lord Falconberg caused some
arrows to be discharged during the snow, at the Lancastrians, and
ordered the archers to fall back three strides (what difference
could three paces make?) and that the Lancastrians, feeling the
shot, but in consequence of the snow, not well knowing the
distance between them and the Yorkists, supposed that they were
within the range of archery, and discharged their arrows, until
their quivers were exhausted, or nearly so, and that the Yorkists
then not only shot their own arrows against the opposite forces,
but also picked up and discharged part of the Lancastrians&rsquo;
arrows against them, and planted others in the ground, which
sorely galled the legs of the Lancastrians, <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>when they
advanced to close quarters.&nbsp; It is easy to believe, that
some amongst the undisciplined Lancastrian archers, would begin
to shoot too soon, just as young troops will even now
occasionally fire too soon; but when we reflect that there were
several men amongst the leaders on both sides, who had served in
France, and had had much experience in war, it is difficult to
suppose that such a circumstance had any material influence in
the result of the battle, or that they would allow their men to
exhaust their quivers, by shooting in such a useless manner;
besides which, if the Lancastrian archers were prevented by the
snow from judging accurately of the distance, the same cause
must, to a great extent, have operated against the archers of the
Yorkists.&nbsp; And with respect to exhausting the quivers, we
cannot suppose that the Lancastrian leaders, after deliberately
preparing for the approach of the Yorkists, would be so remiss,
as not to have a plentiful supply of arrows in the rear for the
use of the troops.&nbsp; It is barely possible that some
instances may have occurred of arrows being stuck into the
ground, but it is not credible that it was done on any
considerable scale.&nbsp; The Yorkists would have something else
to do on such a dreadful morning, than to occupy themselves with
sticking arrows in any considerable numbers in the ground.&nbsp;
Besides which, if such a measure were adopted with any good
effect, at the battle of Towton, it is clear that it would be
equally useful at other battles fought in the middle ages; yet,
as far as I can recollect, we are not informed by any historian,
of such a measure being adopted, on any other occasion, either in
the wars of York and Lancaster, or in any battle in which the
English were engaged.&nbsp; The real disadvantage, and that was a
serious one, under which the Lancastrians laboured, was, that the
wind, with the snow or sleet driven in their faces, would not
only baffle their aim, but would cause a deflection in the flight
of their arrows; besides which, even when they came to close
quarters, it was a great disadvantage to have the snow and sleet
driving against them.&nbsp; There was, however, a good <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>reason for
soon coming to hand blows, which would equally operate on both
armies: the wet from the snow, would affect their bow strings,
and render the bows of both parties comparatively
inefficient.&nbsp; We are also told, that the Yorkists pursued
the Lancastrians during all the night, which succeeded the
battle.&nbsp; It seems to be impossible that that can be
literally true.&nbsp; After two rather severe engagements, and a
hasty march, which, for a considerable space, was through cross
roads, on the 28th of March, and after so long and dreadful a
conflict on the 29th, without food during the day, except that
they might possibly have broken their fast very early in the
morning, fighting in severe weather, exposed to cold and wet, and
with bad roads, the Yorkists must, from sheer exhaustion, and
want of bodily strength, have been scarcely able to pursue the
fugitives after the day had closed in, about which time the
victors would arrive at Tadcaster, glad to find food, shelter,
and rest there, for the night.&nbsp; We hear no more of the
fugitives, as an army, after the 29th; and it is more than
probable, that by the morning of the 30th, they had availed
themselves of the hours of darkness to disperse, or to move
northwards in detached parties merely; and they had one advantage
over the victors: the fugitives could throw away a portion of
their arms, offensive and defensive, to facilitate their
flight.</p>
<p>There is one point in the plans of the Lancastrians connected
with this battle, for which it is very difficult to
account.&nbsp; Why, with superior forces, did they act on the
defensive?&nbsp; It is very easy to understand, that the
Lancastrians retired from before London, and proceeded northward,
after the junction of the forces of Edward with those of the Earl
of Warwick, in consequence of the then superiority of the
Yorkists; but, if as we are told, the Lancastrians shortly
afterwards mustered for the battle of Towton about 60,000 men,
and the Yorkists only about 48,660 men, we should naturally have
expected that the Lancastrians would have been the
assailants.&nbsp; It seems contrary to good policy, in military
affairs, to wait with a superior force to be attacked.&nbsp; <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Such a
general as Cromwell, Marlborough, or Wellington, if commanding a
force tolerably equal, would not have waited for the attack of an
enemy.&nbsp; With the exception, however, of the bold, and at
first the successful, exploit by Lord Clifford, at Ferrybridge,
the Lancastrians were not the assailing, but the defensive
parties. <a name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a>&nbsp; They did not even, as far as we
are informed, attempt either to support Lord Clifford at
Ferrybridge, or to succour him at Dintingdale, where he was
slain, and his forces defeated. <a name="citation122b"></a><a
href="#footnote122b" class="citation">[122b]</a>&nbsp; Yet that
place was only about a mile and a half from Towton; and the
shouts of the combatants would be within hearing of the main body
of the Lancastrian army.&nbsp; The victors may possibly have
exaggerated the number of the Lancastrians, in order to enhance
the merit of the victory.&nbsp; If some such reason cannot be
given, it seems only left to ascribe their remaining on the
defensive, either to ignorance of the numbers of their enemies,
or to want of judgment on the part of the Lancastrian
commanders.</p>
<p>Saxton is a parish containing the townships of Towton and
Saxton-cum-Scarthingwell; the living is a perpetual curacy; and
Saxton Church is dedicated to &ldquo;All Saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great number of the slain were interred, as has been before
mentioned, in a large trench or pit, on the north side of, and
close to, the church.&nbsp; In June, 1848, a short time prior to
my first visit to Towton, their bones were exposed to view, when
making a vault for the interment of a son of John Kendall, Esq.,
of Towton Hall. <a name="citation122c"></a><a
href="#footnote122c" class="citation">[122c]</a>&nbsp; The trench
runs from east to west.&nbsp; <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Besides which, only a few years
before that discovery, another vault was made, nearer to the east
than that of Mr. Kendall, and also on the north side of the
church, and the workmen found a similar deposit of bones, about
four feet below the surface; so that there can be no doubt that
the bones of hundreds of men were buried in a continuous trench
extending along that part of the churchyard. <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a>&nbsp; It has been already mentioned,
that the teeth in the skulls found there were sound and entire,
showing that they had belonged to persons who had died either
young or in the prime of life.</p>
<p>The tomb of Lord Dacre, called by Leland and Stow , &ldquo;a
meane tombe&rdquo; <a name="citation123b"></a><a
href="#footnote123b" class="citation">[123b]</a> (meaning not a
contemptible, or shabby tomb, for it certainly has been a
handsome one, but one of medium size), also lies on the north
side of the church, and very near the place where the slain were
buried.&nbsp; It is about two feet high, with the inscription a
good deal worn, so that I was not able to read many words.&nbsp;
It stands with its sides nearly corresponding with the four
points of the compass; it has armorial bearings on each of its
sides; and, besides various other quarterings, which are much
defaced by age and weather, I observed the quarters&mdash;1st and
4th, Chequy, or and gules, for Vaux of Gillesland; 2nd and 3rd,
Gules, three escallops argent, for Dacre, which, though not very
plain, are nevertheless still visible; and I consider the
engravings of the tomb in Dr. Whitaker&rsquo;s work, very like
the original. <a name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c"
class="citation">[123c]</a></p>
<p>The tomb is of dark stone or marble, and the slab or lid is
very heavy, but broken in two pieces, at about two-thirds its
length; and it seems likely to sustain further injury from boys
playing and climbing upon it.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted,
that some endeavour is not made by some person of taste, to
preserve it by putting iron rails round it.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Some
of the leaders (naturally supposed to be Yorkists) were interred
in the church; and within the recollection of Mr. Kendall, some
slabs, with inscriptions in the Old English letters, were in
existence there, which were said to have covered their
remains.&nbsp; The church is evidently very ancient, principally
of the Gothic style of architecture; but it has been in part
rebuilt and altered, without much regard to its style, so as to
detract very much from its appearance.&nbsp; Formerly there was
some coloured glass in a window of the church, which is said to
have contained the arms of the Dacre family; but, in consequence
of the window requiring repairs, the coloured glass was removed
about thirty years ago, and was taken to the mansion of the late
Thomas Walker, Esq., of Killingbeck, near Leeds, where it perhaps
may yet be.</p>
<p>It has an ancient plain Norman arch, at the doorway in the
south porch; an antique font, large enough to immerse a child;
and a piscina in the Hungate Chapel, which is on the south side;
and one or two very narrow lancet-shaped windows on the north
side of the chancel, are still remaining.</p>
<p>The tower of Saxton Church appears to have been rebuilt after
the Reformation, and, as is said, between two hundred and fifty
and three hundred years ago.&nbsp; Several representations of
crosses have been cut upon slabs or stones which are built into
the tower, and which have evidently been carved in memory of some
of the slain, who were buried there; most probably, some Yorkist
knights or leaders.&nbsp; Several of the crosses have been
transposed and altered, when the tower was rebuilt; and parts of
the shafts and pedestals of two or three of those crosses are
still visible, and are now placed in different layers of the
stone, or in the reverse way to the heads of the crosses, and are
imperfect, parts of them having disappeared, and probably they
have been cut and been removed.&nbsp; On the south side of the
tower there is one of these crosses perfect, or nearly so, and
also part of another; on the west side there is one perfect
cross; and on the north side, including an imperfect part of one
on the adjoining <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>buttress of the tower, there are five imperfect parts
of crosses cut upon the stones; there probably are others which
have since been built inwards into the wall, and are,
consequently, not visible.&nbsp; They have been four or five feet
long, and the two which are nearly perfect, owe their
preservation apparently to their having been cut on stones of
unusual size, and to their not extending, like some others, upon
more stones than one.&nbsp; The heads of those two crosses are
handsome, and a good deal ornamented.&nbsp; There is a sufficient
resemblance amongst the crosses, to show that they were probably
all coeval in point of date; but they are certainly not, as Dr.
Whitaker supposed, all alike.</p>
<p>Sir John Neville, commonly called John Lord Neville, is said
not to have been buried there, but at the chapel of Lead, which
is about half a mile from Saxton, and in the parish of Ryther;
but there is not any monument to his memory.</p>
<p>At the period when Drake wrote (in 1736), Lord Dacre&rsquo;s
tomb was much defaced, and the inscription was imperfect; he has,
however, given it, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="GutSmall">HIC JACET RANULPHUS DS. DE
DAKEE ET &mdash;&mdash; MILES</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ET OCCISUS ERAT IN BELLO PRINCIPE HENRICO

href="#footnote125a" class="citation">[125a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Whitaker, however, who had Drake&rsquo;s work before him
when he wrote, gives the following, as the correct inscription,
with the defects supplied; and states that less than thirty years
before the time when he was writing, he retrieved much more of
it, than would have been then possible:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="GutSmall">HIC JACET RANULPHUS DOMINUS
DE DACRE ET GREYSTOCKE VERUS MILES QUI</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">OBIIT IN BELLO PRO REGE SUO HENRICO SEXTO

class="citation">[125c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Whichever is the correct version, they, however, both
coincide in the main particulars, of its being Lord Dacre&rsquo;s
tomb; that he was a supporter of King Henry VI., and was slain in
battle, on Palm Sunday, 1461.&nbsp; From the mention of King
Henry VI., it may be surmised that the tomb was not erected until
after the death of Edward IV.</p>
<p>Drake mentions, that many years ago, this tomb was violently
wrenched open (for it had been strongly cramped together with
iron), in order to inter beneath it a Mr. Gascoyne, when the
remains of Dacre&rsquo;s body were found, in a standing posture;
and that a fragment of the slab, and a material part of the
inscription, were then broken off.</p>
<p>He does not inform us who or what Mr. Gascoyne was, when
alive; but whoever he was, whether of a high or low sphere in
life, whether he was a gentleman, or some rag-merchant, it
evinced bad taste on the part of his relations or
representatives, to commit such an act; and perhaps some culpable
remissness on the part of the then incumbent of the church, to
permit it.&nbsp; Of Lord Dacre&rsquo;s general character we know
little; but from that circumstance, we are at least justified in
believing, that, unlike two great leaders of the opposite
parties, he was neither perjured like Clarence, nor a murderer
like Clifford; that is certainly only negative praise; but we do
know that he was at least a nobleman of high rank, consistent in
his principles, and one who died a warrior&rsquo;s death, on the
field of battle: circumstances which ought to have preserved his
remains from profanation, <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and ought to have caused us to be
spared the disgust and indignation, which we naturally entertain,
at the bad taste and bad feeling evinced, in the violation of a
soldier&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>In the dreadful wars of York and Lancaster, it is said that
more than 100,000 Englishmen lost their lives; but that is merely
the number believed to have been slain in battle; and, however
repulsive it may be to our feelings, it must be admitted that it
cannot include the numbers who must have perished during that
disastrous period, in unimportant skirmishes, in marauding
parties, in private warfare, by assassination, by the axe or by
the halter, in pursuance of or under the colour of judicial
sentences, or by open and undisguised murder. <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a>&nbsp; Besides this horrible sacrifice
of human life, during this distracted period, it is shocking to
think what sufferings unprotected and helpless persons must have
been exposed to, from the lawless partisans of the rival parties,
when they passed through or were located near any district, which
they chose to consider as favouring their antagonists.&nbsp;
Pillage, cruelty, violence to women, incendiarism, and contempt
of the laws and of religion, <a name="citation127b"></a><a
href="#footnote127b" class="citation">[127b]</a> were the natural
attendants upon a civil war, <a name="citation127c"></a><a
href="#footnote127c" class="citation">[127c]</a> carried on with
feelings of bitter hatred by each party; and it is certain that
the examples of cruelty and wickedness which were openly set by
the nobles and leaders of both factions, would readily be copied
by their followers.&nbsp; Voltaire thus expresses himself, in
reference to the wars of York and Lancaster: &ldquo;Quand les
premiers d&rsquo;une nation ont de telles m&oelig;urs, quelles
doivent &ecirc;tre celles du peuple?&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[127d]</a></p>
<p>One of our ancient historical writers correctly states, that
&ldquo;this conflict was in maner unnaturall, for in it the sonne
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>fought
against the father, the brother against the brother, the nephew

<p>The following is an extract from a very interesting scene,
from the pen of Shakespeare, relative to the battle of Towton;
and, although the tragedy in which it is introduced is not well
adapted to the stage, it will well repay the student for the time
bestowed, in reading the whole of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>The Third Part of

Who&rsquo;s this?&mdash;O Heav&rsquo;n! it is my father&rsquo;s

</blockquote>
<p>It may be said, that the portion of the scene in which those
circumstances are introduced, is one of imagination, and the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>offspring
of the grand and admirable talents of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Be it
so; still the truthful records of history disclose quite enough,
to prove that deeds of bloodshed and violence, nearly as
repulsive to our feelings, and almost as disgraceful to mankind,
as those which that scene represents, were frequently perpetrated
during those disastrous times; and we may well feel grateful to
the supreme Disposer of events, that we are now preserved from
the miseries and calamities which were experienced in this
country, during the wars of York and Lancaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the numerous battles which have

<a name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a>&nbsp; In order that the positions of
the hostile armies, and the reason why the battle happened to be
fought close to the town of Tewkesbury, may be correctly

of battle, to notice concisely, some of the events which
immediately preceded it. <a name="citation131c"></a><a

<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>On
the 18th or 14th of April, 1471, <a name="citation132a"></a><a

John Longstrother, Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem,
<a name="citation132d"></a><a href="#footnote132d"
class="citation">[132d]</a> and several persons of consideration,
arrived from France, and landed at the port of Weymouth, in
Dorsetshire, with a small body of French and other troops; and
she proceeded from thence to the Abbey of Cerne, <a
name="citation132e"></a><a href="#footnote132e"
class="citation">[132e]</a> not far from that port.&nbsp; <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>The
Countess of Warwick had accompanied her from France, but in a
different ship, which outsailed that of the Queen. <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a></p>
<p>Margaret was at first almost broken-hearted and overwhelmed,
by the dismal tidings of the loss of the battle of Barnet, the
defeat and destruction of her friends, and the captivity of her
husband; but in consequence of being encouraged by Edmund Duke of
Somerset; <a name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a> Lord John Beaufort; <a
name="citation133c"></a><a href="#footnote133c"

<a name="citation133d"></a><a href="#footnote133d"
class="citation">[133d]</a> Lord Wenlock, <a
name="citation133e"></a><a href="#footnote133e"
class="citation">[133e]</a> and other persons of rank, and
gentlemen, who promised her their support, she determined once
more to try the chances of a battle.</p>
<p>The noblemen and gentlemen of her party, immediately adopted
measures for mustering their retainers and followers, and with
that view repaired to Exeter, sent for Sir John Arundel, and Sir
Hugh Courtenay, and raised forces in Somersetshire, Dorsetshire,
Wiltshire, and afterwards in Cornwall and Devonshire; and
proceeded from Exeter by Taunton, Glastonbury, and Wells, to
Bath, and from thence to Bristol: their forces being continually
increased on their march.&nbsp; Their intention was to have
marched through Gloucestershire into Wales, where Jasper Earl of
Pembroke, <a name="citation133f"></a><a href="#footnote133f"
class="citation">[133f]</a> a powerful and staunch Lancastrian,
<a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>was in
arms, and raising forces for that party; and they also expected
to receive assistance from their partisans in Cheshire and
Lancashire.</p>
<p>Edward, in the mean time, after receiving intelligence of the
landing of Queen Margaret, being uncertain towards what quarter
the Lancastrians would bend their course, departed on the 19th of
April, with some of his forces, furnished with artillery and
other things requisite, from London for Windsor, where he
remained a short time, for the double purpose of celebrating the
feast of St. George, and of awaiting the arrival of other troops,
whom he had appointed to assemble there.&nbsp; He commenced his
march from Windsor, against the enemy, on the morrow after St.
George&rsquo;s day, the 24th of April.&nbsp; He reached Abingdon
on Saturday the 27th, remained there all Sunday, and on Monday
the 29th, proceeded to Cirencester, <a name="citation134a"></a><a
href="#footnote134a" class="citation">[134a]</a> where he
received information, that on the next day (Tuesday), his enemies
intended to be at Bath, and that on the Wednesday they would come
forward, and give him battle; and Edward, desirous to see his men
in order of battle, led them out of the town, and encamped in the
field three miles from it.</p>
<p>On the next day, Edward, still seeking to encounter his
enemies, marched to Malmesbury, when he learned that they had
turned aside and gone to Bristol.&nbsp; On Thursday <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a> Edward arrived at Sodbury, and
shortly before the arrival of the main body of his army there, a
skirmish took place; a few of his men, riding into the town to
secure quarters and accommodations, encountered and were attacked
by some of the enemy, who had been sent forward from the
Lancastrian army, and five or six <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of the Yorkists were made
prisoners.&nbsp; Edward having some reason to think that the
Lancastrians were near at hand, sent out scouts to endeavour to
obtain intelligence of their movements; but not hearing any
certain tidings of them, he lodged his vanguard in a valley,
beyond the hill, towards the town of Sodbury, and lay himself
with the residue of his forces at Sodbury Hill.&nbsp; About three
o&rsquo;clock after midnight, he received information, that the
Lancastrians had taken their way by Berkeley towards Gloucester;
and he in consequence, after taking the advice of his council,
sent with all speed to Sir Richard Beauchamp, the son of William
Lord Beauchamp of Powick, <a name="citation135"></a><a
href="#footnote135" class="citation">[135]</a> to whom he had
committed the government of the city and castle of Gloucester,
with orders not to admit Margaret&rsquo;s forces into them, but
to defend them to the utmost.</p>
<p>At Bristol the Lancastrians received assistance, both in men,
victuals, money, and artillery, and on Thursday proceeded to
Berkeley, and marched from thence towards Gloucester, travelling
all night, and arrived before Gloucester at ten o&rsquo;clock on
Friday, and hoped to be admitted into that city, and to pass the
Severn there, in order to effect a junction with the Earl of
Pembroke.</p>
<p>But as King Edward IV. had previously sent orders to the
Governor of Gloucester, to refuse admittance to Margaret and her
adherents, and had promised that, if the city were assailed, he
would advance immediately to its relief, his orders were obeyed,
and Margaret was unable to obtain admittance.&nbsp; To the
circumstance of her being baffled in the design of passing the
Severn at Gloucester, may be ascribed, the utter ruin, which so
soon after befell her and her army; in fact the issue of the
campaign might very probably have been completely different, if
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>she had
succeeded in getting possession of Gloucester, and of securing a
safe passage for her forces over the Severn, and, consequently,
of effecting a junction with the troops raised by the Earl of
Pembroke.</p>
<p>She proceeded from Gloucester towards Tewkesbury, having then
no alternative, with reference to her design of passing the
river, but to march to the latter town; and on the way thither,
some of her artillery were captured from her rearguard. <a
name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a"
class="citation">[136a]</a>&nbsp; She arrived at Tewkesbury on
Friday the 3rd of May, about four in the afternoon, having
travelled on that day and the preceding night, thirty-six long
miles, through bad roads, between woods, and without proper
refreshment, so that both men and horses were greatly
fatigued.&nbsp; It became absolutely necessary, to give some rest
to her exhausted troops, most part of which consisted of
infantry; and it was determined by the leaders of her forces, to
await at Tewkesbury the coming up of Edward&rsquo;s army, and to
take the chances of a battle.</p>
<p>The Lancastrians, as we learn from one of our old historians,
encamped &ldquo;in a close even hard at the Townes end having the
Towne and Abbeie at their backes, and directlie before them, and
upon each side of them they were defended with cumbersome lanes,
deepe ditches, and manie hedges, beside hils and dales, so as the
place seemed as noisome as might be to approach unto.&rdquo; <a
name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b"
class="citation">[136b]</a>&nbsp; Whether the position was or was
not as strong and difficult to be assailed, as is here
represented, it is at all events certain, that the Lancastrians
fortified it, at least to some extent, and prepared to act on the
defensive; with the hope of holding out against Edward, until the
arrival of the Earl of Pembroke, who was supposed to be rapidly
approaching.&nbsp; There can scarcely be a reasonable doubt, that
during the evening and night previous to the battle, the
Lancastrians exerted themselves assiduously to intrench and
fortify their position.&nbsp; It is worthy <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of notice,
that we do not hear of any attempt by the Lancastrians, to pass
the Severn at Tewkesbury; and as they prepared to act on the
defensive, and not to be the attacking party at the approaching
battle, it may at first sight perhaps appear remarkable, that
they do not seem to have endeavoured to have had the river Severn
interposed between themselves and their enemies, especially as it
flows close to Tewkesbury.&nbsp; But the reason for their not
attempting it, may easily be found, in the exhausted state of
their troops, and the near approach of Edward&rsquo;s army, which
rendered it a very dangerous attempt to cross the river with the
enemy so close upon them. <a name="citation137a"></a><a
href="#footnote137a" class="citation">[137a]</a>&nbsp; Besides
which, there was not a bridge over the Severn at Tewkesbury,
before the present iron bridge was completed in 1826, at the
place where there was an old ferry called the Upper Lode; and
Leland expressly states, that even as late as when he wrote (in
the reign of Henry VIII.), there was not any bridge
there:&mdash;&ldquo;There is noe Bridge on Severne beneath
Gloucester&mdash;neither is there any bridge on Severne above
Gloucester, till the Townlett of Upton a 11 or 12 miles from
Gloucester.&rdquo; <a name="citation137b"></a><a
href="#footnote137b" class="citation">[137b]</a></p>
<p>If Margaret and her army had attempted to cross the Severn at
Tewkesbury, in hopes of joining the Earl of Pembroke, the want of
a bridge would naturally have compelled them, to have crossed it
by fords and ferries, as they best could: a perilous attempt, and
one which would almost certainly have exposed the rear of the
army to destruction.&nbsp; That would of course be an additional
and powerful reason, for their being compelled to take the
chances of a battle. <a name="citation137c"></a><a
href="#footnote137c" class="citation">[137c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>King
Edward, having received tidings that the Queen&rsquo;s forces
were proceeding towards Tewkesbury, commenced his march from
Sodbury, with his army in good order of battle in three bodies,
very early in the morning of Friday, the 3rd of May, and passed
over Cotswold.&nbsp; The day was very hot, and the King marched
with his forces more than thirty miles; during which, they could
neither find food for man or horse, and his troops were much
distressed for want of water, having met with only one small
brook, which soon became so disturbed and foul, by so large a
number of men, carriages, and horses passing through it, as to be
unfit for use.&nbsp; During a considerable part of that day, the
King&rsquo;s army and that of his enemies were within five or six
miles of each other: his in a plain country, and theirs amongst
woods.&nbsp; He had constantly useful scouts, to inform him of
the movements of his enemies.&nbsp; At length he came with his
army to Cheltenham, &ldquo;unto a village called
Chiltenham,&rdquo; <a name="citation138a"></a><a
href="#footnote138a" class="citation">[138a]</a> where he had
certain intelligence, that the Queen&rsquo;s forces were already
come to Tewkesbury, and were encamped, and intended to remain and
give him battle there.</p>
<p>Edward did not remain long at Cheltenham; but after his
troops, which consisted of 3000 infantry and a large body of
cavalry, had had some refreshment, they marched forward towards
Tewkesbury, and passed the night of the 3rd of May encamped in
the field, near <a name="citation138b"></a><a
href="#footnote138b" class="citation">[138b]</a> the Lancastrian
position.</p>
<p>On the next morning, Saturday the 4th of May, <a
name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a> Edward <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>advanced to attack his enemies in
three bodies: his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a> commanded the van; Edward in person,
with his brother the Duke of Clarence, <a
name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a> commanded the centre; and the rear
was commanded by the Marquis of Dorset <a
name="citation139c"></a><a href="#footnote139c"
class="citation">[139c]</a> and Lord Hastings. <a
name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d"
class="citation">[139d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Edward, prior to the commencement of the battle, had
observed that there was a park <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a> and much wood
growing in it, on the right hand of his enemies&rsquo; camp; and
in order to guard against an ambuscade from that quarter, he
ordered two hundred spearmen to proceed to it, about a quarter of
a mile from the field; and if there were no ambuscade, then to
act and assist the army, in such a manner, as circumstances might
seem to render advisable.</p>
<p>The Lancastrian army was arranged also in three bodies, behind
the natural defences of the position, and such intrenchments, as
had been assiduously formed in so short a time; the Duke of
Somerset and his brother Lord John Beaufort commanded the first
line; Prince Edward, Lord Wenlock, and the Prior of St. John,
commanded the second; and the Earl of Devonshire the third.</p>
<p>We learn from one of the old historians, that the
Queen&rsquo;s position was, &ldquo;right hard to be assailed, by
reason of the deep ditches, hedges, trees, bushes, and cumbersome
lanes wherewith the same was fenced both a front and on the
sides.&rdquo; <a name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b"
class="citation">[140b]</a></p>
<p>Some openings were left by the Lancastrians in their
intrenchments, in order to enable them, if it should be
considered expedient, to sally forth upon the Yorkists: a
circumstance which seems not to have been known at first to the
leaders of the latter.</p>
<p>Before the battle commenced, the Queen and Prince Edward rode
about the field, encouraging the men, and promising them rewards
and booty, if they acquitted themselves well.</p>
<p>Both of the armies used cannons.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s army
was well furnished with great artillery, which was well placed to
annoy his enemies, and the Duke of Gloucester galled them
severely with discharges of arrows; and the Lancastrians repaid
them in <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>the same manner with shot of artillery, and arrows,
although they had not as many guns as the King had.</p>
<p>The Duke of Gloucester with his forces made a fierce attack
upon the Lancastrians, but was unable to force their lines; in
fact it was scarcely practicable for them to come to hand blows
with their enemies, from the peculiarities and difficult nature
of their position; and after a short time he purposely retired
from before their intrenchments with his men, and with an
appearance of being repulsed, in order to tempt the Duke of
Somerset from his stronghold.&nbsp; Somerset rashly quitted the
intrenchments through the openings already mentioned, and with
his men pursued the Duke of Gloucester into the open field, when
the latter suddenly ordered his forces to halt, and recover their
ranks, and face their enemies, which was accordingly done; and
the Duke of Gloucester with the Yorkists immediately attacked the
troops of the Duke of Somerset, repulsed them, put them to
flight, and pursued them towards their camp.</p>
<p>The two hundred spearmen were of great use on this occasion,
as they advanced to the assistance of Gloucester, and suddenly
charged Somerset and his Lancastrian troops in their flank, when
they had already enough to do, from being engaged with the
others; and, dismayed at this new charge upon them, they gave
way, and attempted to regain their camp, and were pursued by the
King and Gloucester with the Yorkist forces. <a
name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a"
class="citation">[141a]</a></p>
<p>Some of the fugitives &ldquo;fled into the parke, other into
the meadow there at hand, some into the lanes, and some hid them
in ditches, each one making what shift he could, by the which he
hoped best to escape; but manie neverthelesse were beaten downe,
slaine, and taken prisoners.&rdquo; <a name="citation141b"></a><a
href="#footnote141b" class="citation">[141b]</a></p>
<p>Lord Wenlock not having advanced to the support of the first
line, but remaining stationary, contrary to the expectations of
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Somerset, the latter, in a rage, rode up to him,
reviled him, and beat his brains out with his axe.</p>
<p>Gloucester and his troops, pursuing those that fled with
Somerset, forced their way into the intrenchments, and were
supported by the King, who conducted himself very valiantly; the
Lancastrians soon gave way, the second and third lines making
little resistance; the rout became general, and was attended with
great slaughter; and upon the camp being forced, almost all such
of the defenders as stood their ground were killed.</p>
<p>The Lancastrians fled towards the town, and were hotly pursued
by the victors, the King and others joining in the pursuit, and
many of the fugitives were slain, and &ldquo;at a mill in a
meadow fast by the town, a great sort were drowned.&nbsp; Manie
ran towards the towne, some to the church, and diverse to the
abbeie, and other to other places, where they thought best to
save themselves.&rdquo; <a name="citation142a"></a><a
href="#footnote142a" class="citation">[142a]</a></p>
<p>In this decisive battle, and in the pursuit, about 3000
Lancastrians were slain, with the following leaders:&mdash;The
Earl of Devonshire, Lord John Beaufort, Lord Wenlock, Sir Edmund
Hamden, Sir William Wittingham, Sir William Vaux, Sir Nicholas
Hartry, Sir John Delves, <a name="citation142b"></a><a
href="#footnote142b" class="citation">[142b]</a> Sir William
Fielding, Sir John Lewkener, Sir William Lermouth, Sir John
Urnan, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir William Rouse, and Sir Thomas
Fitzhenry. <a name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c"
class="citation">[142c]</a>&nbsp; The Duke of Somerset, the Prior
of St. John, and other individuals of distinction, escaped from
the field, and sought refuge in the neighbouring Abbey
Church.&nbsp; They were pursued thither by King Edward, who
attempted to enter the church with his sword drawn, but was
stopped at the porch by a priest, with the Host, <a
name="citation142d"></a><a href="#footnote142d"
class="citation">[142d]</a> who prohibited his defiling the
sacred edifice with blood.</p>
<p>Prince Edward was taken prisoner by Sir Richard Crofts, and <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>in
consequence of a proclamation, made by the King&rsquo;s orders,
that whosoever should produce the Prince, should receive an
annuity of one hundred pounds, and that the Prince&rsquo;s life
should be spared if he were brought forward unhurt, he was
conducted by Sir Richard Crofts into the King&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Here an act of wickedness and cruelty took place,
similar to and equally detestable, with that which was
perpetrated by Lord Clifford, a leader of the other party,
against the young Earl of Rutland, after the battle of
Wakefield.&nbsp; The King having asked, in a haughty manner, how
Prince Edward had dared to invade his dominions, and being
irritated by an imprudent and hasty reply from the youthful
captive, struck him on the face with his gauntlet.&nbsp; This
seems to have been considered a sufficient encouragement to
others, to proceed to a deed of savage violence against the
unhappy Prince, and the Marquis of Dorset, Lord Hastings, the
Dukes of Clarence <a name="citation143a"></a><a
href="#footnote143a" class="citation">[143a]</a> and Gloucester,
and some <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>others, dragged the Prince away, and murdered him with
their daggers. <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a>&nbsp; His corpse was buried in a
common grave, in the Abbey Church, with some of the soldiers who
had been slain in the battle.&nbsp; The King pardoned a number of
the fugitives, who had taken refuge in the Abbey Church, although
it did not possess any privilege to protect rebels; and he might
have taken them out of it without breach of any liberty of that
church; and he allowed the bodies of the noblemen and others
slain in the battle, to be buried in the church, or wherever
their friends or servants pleased; nor was there any quartering
or setting up in public places, of the heads, or quarters, either
of those who had been slain, or of those who had been executed: a
disgusting exhibition, which had too often been witnessed during
the wars of the Roses.</p>
<p>Near the centre of the choir, under the tower, is a brass
plate, let into a stone slab in the floor, with the following
inscription, commemorating the murder of the young
Prince:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NE TOTA PEREAT MEMORIA</span><br />

</blockquote>
<p>The inscription was written by the late Rev. Robert Knight,
vicar of Tewkesbury, and was placed there in 1796, in accordance
with a tradition that the body of the Prince had been <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>interred
there.&nbsp; It was ascertained, by an examination some years
ago, that the slab upon which the brass plate is affixed, was
over a stone coffin.&nbsp; The latter was examined, but it did

<p>In the addition to Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>, by Gough,
it is stated, that there was a monument in the chancel of the
church, to the memory of George Duke of Clarence and Isabel his
wife; and that near the entrance of the choir, under a large grey
marble flag, stripped of its brasses, Prince Edward was interred
after his murder.&nbsp; &ldquo;This deed is supposed to have been
done in a house since rebuilt, now Mr. Webb&rsquo;s, an
ironmonger, on the north side of the High Street, near the
Tolsey.&nbsp; His bones and coffin were discovered by the
breaking of the stone.&rdquo; <a name="citation145b"></a><a
href="#footnote145b" class="citation">[145b]</a></p>
<p>Two days after the battle, Edward caused Somerset and other
fugitives to be taken from the sanctuary of the Abbey
Church.&nbsp; They were brought before the Duke of Gloucester,
who officiated as high constable, and the Duke of Norfolk the
marshal, by whom they were condemned to death; and accordingly,

<p>Tewkesbury is a small town, situated ten miles from

<p>The field of the battle of Tewkesbury is close to the first
mile-post <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a> on the turnpike road, leading from
Tewkesbury, through Tredington to Cheltenham and
Gloucester.&nbsp; For the information of persons desirous of
visiting it, it may be well to observe, that on the westward side
of the town of Tewkesbury, there is a range of elevated ground,
called the Holme Ground, or Holme Hill, where a castle once
stood, <a name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c"
class="citation">[149c]</a> the rise of which commences very near
the town, upon part of which, contiguous to the turnpike road,
the union workhouse stands, and close behind the latter there is
a field called the Gastons; and immediately beyond the union
workhouse, are two fields which were purchased in 1855, for the
purpose of, and are now laid out as, a cemetery for Tewkesbury,
and are called in the title-deeds, part of &ldquo;the
Gastons,&rdquo; a name which I shall afterwards have again to
refer to.&nbsp; This high ground extends on the side of the
turnpike road, as far as the first mile-post; just opposite to
which, and on the eastward side of the road, is a field which has
immemorially been called &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s Camp,&rdquo; and
which is situated upon a part of the elevated ground which is
called Gupshill.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>The
battle appears to have been fought at that place, and in the
adjacent fields to the southward, and also in those a little to
the eastward of it, <a name="citation150a"></a><a
href="#footnote150a" class="citation">[150a]</a> and on the spot
where Gupshill Farm houses and gardens now stand.</p>
<p>The high road from Cheltenham did not formerly pass as close
to Margaret&rsquo;s Camp as at present.&nbsp; Within the memory
of persons now living, it turned out of the present turnpike road
from Cheltenham, in the descent of the hill, two or three
fields&rsquo; breadth before arriving at the first mile-post from
Tewkesbury, and wound with a considerable curve round the
westward side of Gupshill Farm houses and buildings, at which
place, part of the old road still remains, and joins the turnpike
road at a spot sixty or eighty yards nearer Tewkesbury than the
first mile-post. <a name="citation150b"></a><a
href="#footnote150b" class="citation">[150b]</a></p>
<p>In the field called &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s Camp,&rdquo; are
some slight inequalities in the ground; but they are not
sufficiently decided to enable any person to state that they are
the remains of intrenchments; and in the centre of the field
there is a small circular enclosure, which measures as nearly as
I could judge, by stepping over it, about twenty-eight or
twenty-nine yards across.&nbsp; It is surrounded by a small and
shallow ditch, <a name="citation150c"></a><a href="#footnote150c"
class="citation">[150c]</a> which was dry when I visited it; and
is without any hedge or bank; it has, however, a number of large
elm-trees growing round its inner edge.&nbsp; It is too
insignificant to have formed part of the military intrenchments;
but it may possibly have been a place of interment of some of the
slain; or, as seems probable, it may have been formed in
comparatively modern times, by some owner of <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>the land,
to commemorate the spot where the Lancastrian army was
posted.</p>
<p>It may readily be admitted, that the Lancastrians might have
formed their encampment, in some place possessing greater natural
strength, on the north instead of the south side of the town; but
in that case, they must most unwisely have abandoned to their
enemies, the advantages of the possession of the town, and the
command of the river, and would have enabled them to intercept
the reinforcements which were expected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible to find any place near the town, where an
army intending to await and give battle to the Yorkists, when
they advanced by the road from Cheltenham, could have been so
advantageously posted, as at the spot before mentioned.&nbsp;
Although perhaps not naturally very strong, the position was, of
course, strengthened by artificial defences, which we may
conclude, were then adopted, as has frequently occurred on
similar occasions, as for example by baggage waggons, fallen
trees, and intrenchments; and it had the additional defences of
hedges, ditches, brushwood, &amp;c.&nbsp; It was approached on
three sides by ascents, which, though not steep, were at least
disadvantageous to the assailants; and it was situated at the end
of the tract of elevated ground before noticed. <a
name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a>&nbsp; The field before mentioned
belongs to Mr. Haywood, and is tenanted by Mr. John Phillips; and
I was informed by elderly people, when I visited it, that human
bones had formerly been discovered in the immediate neighbourhood
of it; but I was not able to learn that any other <i>indicia</i>
of the battle had been found there.&nbsp; It is not possible for
any <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>intelligent person to mistake the spot, if he is
desirous to find it, when he has walked a mile from Tewkesbury on
the turnpike road.&nbsp; The place is called
&ldquo;Gupshill,&rdquo; and is in the parish of Tewkesbury. <a
name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>The old annalists and chronicles have left us much in the
dark, as to the exact place near the camp of the Lancastrians,
where Edward&rsquo;s forces passed the night prior to the battle;
but on the morning of the battle, and immediately before it
commenced, his army, according both to tradition and probability,
took up a position upon some elevated ground, adjoining the
turnpike road, and to the southward of, and scarcely half a mile
from, the Lancastrian army.&nbsp; From that position, a small
tract of ground (now inclosed fields) slopes downwards so as to
form a depression between it and the spot occupied by the
Lancastrians.&nbsp; This tract of ground was formerly called the
Red Piece; and is intersected by the turnpike road, leading
towards Cheltenham and Gloucester, and at present forms two
fields, one of which, on the right side of the road, is called
the Near Red Close, and the other, on the left side of the road,
is called the Further Red Close, belonging to Mr. Naish, of
Bristol, of which the tenant is Mr. William Brown, a farmer and
cattle-dealer.&nbsp; The portion of it on the left side of the
road extends to the field called Margaret&rsquo;s Camp; and it
was on the southward side of the latter, that Edward&rsquo;s
forces appear to have made their attack.</p>
<p>A meadow rather in the rear of the Lancastrian position, but
lying on the westward side of the turnpike road, half a mile from
Tewkesbury, and within a few hundred yards of the Tewkesbury
union workhouse, is called the Bloody Meadow; it belongs to Miss
Shapland, and is tenanted by Mr. William Trotman, innkeeper and
farmer; and an idea is generally entertained, that it derived its
name from the slaughter of many of the fugitives, who fled from
the battle towards the meadow, <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>probably in hopes of getting over
the Severn, as there is a ford and ferry called Lower Lode, near
it.&nbsp; On the 27th of May, 1856, when I last visited the field
of battle, a husbandman who was at work in the garden of Gupshill
Farm, informed me, that when he was working a few years ago in a
field near Lower Lode Ferry, in the immediate neighbourhood of
the Bloody Meadow, he found a quantity of horses bones, and a
considerable number of horseshoes in the ground there.&nbsp; Mr.
William Trotman informed me, that fourteen or fifteen years ago,
he found in the Bloody Meadow a long piece of iron, which from
its appearance, he believed had been part of a sword-blade.&nbsp;
He also showed me a cannon ball of small size, weighing one pound
six ounces, which had been dug up in the same meadow. <a
name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a"
class="citation">[153a]</a></p>
<p>Besides the importance which we may fairly attach to
tradition, and to the name &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s Camp,&rdquo;
it is very remarkable how many strong proofs are afforded, by the
works of the ancient annalists and chroniclers, that the
before-mentioned spot, contiguous to the high road from
Tewkesbury to Cheltenham and Gloucester, was the place where the
battle was fought.</p>
<p>We know from one of the old writers, <a
name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a> that Edward advanced by the road from
Cheltenham towards Tewkesbury.&nbsp; The spot above mentioned, is
on that road, on a slight eminence, which was the best position
near Tewkesbury, that could have been selected by an army, with a
view to giving battle to Edward&rsquo;s forces, on their advance
from Cheltenham.</p>
<p>We are also told by one of our old chroniclers, with reference
to the position selected by Somerset, that he &ldquo;so fyxed in
a fayre parke adioning to the towne he pytched hys felde;&rdquo;
<a name="citation153c"></a><a href="#footnote153c"
class="citation">[153c]</a> and we learn from another of them,
that the position occupied by the Lancastrians, was, &ldquo;even
hard at the Town&rsquo;s end.&rdquo; <a
name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a>&nbsp; The field called
Margaret&rsquo;s Camp, may be very correctly said to be
&ldquo;adjoining to the towne,&rdquo; for it is only one mile
from it by the <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>turnpike road, and is in fact &ldquo;at the
Town&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; because it is little more than half a
mile in a direct line from the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>We also find from the same authority, that &ldquo;the
Lancastrians had the town and abbey at their backs.&rdquo; <a
name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a"
class="citation">[154a]</a>&nbsp; This also tallies precisely
with the position already described, as being occupied by them,
as the abbey is visible from it; and the town and abbey must of
necessity, be in their rear [&ldquo;at their backs&rdquo;], when
they faced an enemy advancing towards Tewkesbury from
Cheltenham.</p>
<p>The field is stated in Warkworth&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> to
be &ldquo;not ferre from the ryver of Severne.&rdquo; <a
name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b"
class="citation">[154b]</a>&nbsp; That account is also very
important, for the place is not more than about half a mile from
the river Severn.</p>
<p>Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, <a name="citation154c"></a><a
href="#footnote154c" class="citation">[154c]</a> in adverting to
the battle, uses the following remarkable
expression:&mdash;&ldquo;Edwardus Princeps Henric VI filius venit
cum exercitu ad Theokesbury, &amp; intravit campum nomine
<i>Gastum</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c., and again, &ldquo;Nomina occisorum
in bello <i>Gastiensis</i> prope Theokesbury,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; I have already mentioned that upon part of the
elevated ground before noticed, and at the back of the union
workhouse, near Tewkesbury, and very near the spot called
Margaret&rsquo;s Camp, there is a place called &ldquo;the
Gastons&rdquo;; and after allowing for the difference in spelling
at the time when Leland wrote, it can scarcely admit of a doubt,
that the latter was the place which he meant, when, in adverting
to the battle, he used the expression&mdash;&ldquo;campum nomine
Gastum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in bello Gastiensis prope
Theokesbury.&rdquo; <a name="citation154d"></a><a
href="#footnote154d" class="citation">[154d]</a></p>
<p>We are also informed by one of the old historians, that many
of the Lancastrians were drowned at &ldquo;a mill in the meadow
fast by the town.&rdquo; <a name="citation154e"></a><a
href="#footnote154e" class="citation">[154e]</a>&nbsp; This must
certainly have been the Abbey <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Water-mills, which (although at
present, in a great degree, rebuilt and altered) still stand in
the meadow close to the town, in the rear of the Lancastrians,
and in a place where it is almost certain that some of the
fugitives from the battle, trying to escape towards the Avon and
the Severn, would pass.</p>
<p>It is also a well-authenticated historical fact, which has not
been disputed by any author, that the Duke of Somerset, John
Longstrother the Lord Prior of St. John&rsquo;s, Sir Thomas
Tresham, Sir Gervase Clifton, and other knights and esquires,
when the battle was lost, fled to the Abbey of Tewkesbury, and
other places in the town.&nbsp; The distance was, as already
mentioned, only about half a mile from the rear of the
Lancastrian position to the Abbey Church and town; and if
Margaret&rsquo;s forces had not awaited the approach of, and
given battle to, the Yorkists on the southward side of
Tewkesbury, or, in other words, on the side of the town which the
Yorkists must naturally approach on the road from Cheltenham, and
with the abbey and the town in the rear of the Lancastrians, it
would have been utterly impossible for the fugitives to have fled
either to the abbey or town.</p>

(<i>Bosworth Field</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 3rd of June, 1856, I visited
the celebrated Field of the Battle of Bosworth, <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a> so called from its contiguity to the
town of Market Bosworth, in Leicestershire, which is in sight of,
and <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>little more than a mile distant from, the field.&nbsp;
It is a locality of great interest, from being the place where
Richard III., the last of the Plantagenet Kings, <a
name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a"
class="citation">[158a]</a> lost his throne and life, on the 22nd
of August, 1485, in battle; the result of which placed his rival,
Henry Earl of Richmond, <a name="citation158b"></a><a
href="#footnote158b" class="citation">[158b]</a> upon the throne
of England, by the title of Henry VII.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>The
description of the field and of the battle, given by that
painstaking antiquary W. Hutton, F.S.A., is so full, that I am
unable to add much to the stock of information on those subjects,
which is contained in his interesting work, to which, however,
several references will be found in the following pages.</p>
<p>He has expressed some surprise, at the changes which had taken
place between his visit in 1788, and that in 1807.&nbsp; He
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I paid a visit in July 1807, to Bosworth
Field; but found so great an alteration, since I saw it in 1788,
that I was totally lost.&nbsp; The manor had been enclosed; the
fences were grown up; and my prospect impeded.&nbsp; King
Richard&rsquo;s Well, which figures in our histories, was nearly
obliterated; the swamp where he fell, become firm land; and the
rivulet proceeding from it, lost in an under-drain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a></p>
<p>If so great a change had occurred prior to July 1807, it may
well be imagined, that a still greater change had occurred when I
visited it in 1856.&nbsp; On that occasion, I had the benefit of
the local information and knowledge possessed by Mr. John Rubley,
an extensive farmer, and a very well informed person, residing at
Dadlington Fields, near there, who was kind enough to accompany
me, and explain the various positions and points of the field of
battle, without which, I should have found it impossible to have
understood them, even with the aid of a copy of the plan of the
field, from Mr. Hutton&rsquo;s work, which I carried with me.</p>
<p>Amongst other changes which have occurred there, and which
have altered its appearance, may be mentioned, the cutting of the
Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal, which extends through part of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutton states, that the south end of the field, by which
Henry advanced, is three miles from Bosworth; and was, when <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>he wrote, a
wood of many acres. <a name="citation160a"></a><a
href="#footnote160a" class="citation">[160a]</a>&nbsp; He adds,
&ldquo;About thirty yards above the wood is a spring, called at
this day King Richard&rsquo;s Well.&nbsp; A small discharge of
water flows from the well, directly down the hill, through the
wood, into the rivulet; but, having no channel cut for its
passage, it penetrates through the soil, and forms that morass
which Henry is said to have left on his right.&nbsp; Amyon Hill
is nearly in the centre of the field, and is by much the highest
ground; the summit is two or three hundred yards beyond the
well.&nbsp; The hill has a steep descent on every side, but is
steepest towards the north, or the Bosworth side, and terminates
with a rill, a bog, and a flat, called Amyon Lays.&nbsp; The
field extends a mile farther towards Bosworth, but that part was
not the scene of action.&rdquo; <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a></p>
<p>He also informs us, that after Richard had made an oration, or
address to his forces, his army marched <i>in battalia</i>, to
Amyon Hill, where they arrived before Henry. <a
name="citation160c"></a><a href="#footnote160c"
class="citation">[160c]</a></p>
<p>The wood called Amyon (or Ambien) Wood, still remains, and is,
of course, much grown and changed, since Mr. Hutton&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; A portion of the ground upon which it stands, seems
to have been the scene of at least a part of the engagement. <a
name="citation160d"></a><a href="#footnote160d"
class="citation">[160d]</a>&nbsp; I walked with my son, Mr.
Alexander Brooke, through a portion of it, and found that part
rather wet and spongy; but there was not then any appearance of
what could with propriety be called a morass, either in the wood,
or below the well, or at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutton, in his account of the position of Richard&rsquo;s
army, immediately before the battle commenced, and of the place
to which he considers Richard&rsquo;s right wing extended, states
that &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s right extended to the declivity of
the hill, on the Bosworth side, called Cornhill Furze, <a
name="citation160e"></a><a href="#footnote160e"
class="citation">[160e]</a> or Amyon Lays, and his <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>left
towards King Richard&rsquo;s well.&rdquo; <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a>&nbsp; But it would perhaps be more
correct and clear, to state, that the King&rsquo;s right wing
extended along the summit of Amyon Hill, towards the declivity,
which slopes down in the direction of Market Bosworth, and of the
road leading from Shenton to Sutton Cheney; that his centre
occupied the ground where Amyon Hill Farm, tenanted by Mr.
Bradfield, now is; and that his left wing probably extended a
little beyond King Richard&rsquo;s Well, which seems to have been
in the front of a portion of his left wing.&nbsp; Consequently,
Richard&rsquo;s army must have faced to the south-westward, with
Market Bosworth and Sutton Cheney, at a little distance, in its
rear; and that of Henry, must have faced to the
north-eastward.&nbsp; The precise position of the armies must,
however, be admitted to be in some measure conjectural.</p>
<p>The marches of the hostile armies before the battle, may be
concisely described thus:&mdash;Richmond set sail from Harfleur,
on Sunday the 31st of July, 1485; landed at Milford Haven on the
6th of August; marched through Wales, by Dell, Haverfordwest,
Cardigan, New Town, and Welsh Pool, to Shrewsbury, and then
through Newport and Stafford, to Lichfield, where he encamped for
a day or two, and arrived at Tamworth on the evening of the 18th.
<a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; On the 19th, he went to
Atherstone, where Lord Stanley <a name="citation161c"></a><a
href="#footnote161c" class="citation">[161c]</a> and Sir William
Stanley <a name="citation161d"></a><a href="#footnote161d"
class="citation">[161d]</a> had an interview with him, and
concerted the measures for their future operations.&nbsp; During
all his march, he had constant additions to his forces, for
others came in and joined him.&nbsp; On the 20th he encamped at
Atherstone; and on the 21st, both armies were in sight of each
other for the whole day; <a name="citation161e"></a><a
href="#footnote161e" class="citation">[161e]</a> Henry having
encamped at Whitemoors, close to the place where the battle of
Bosworth was fought on the next day.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>It is
impossible to suppose that Henry could have acted with such
folly, as to sail from France, with a very small body of men,
described by Commines as a very sorry and unsoldierlike set, from
gaols, hospitals, &amp;c., and land in Wales, and from thence
march into the heart of England, where any serious disaster must
have caused the utter ruin of himself and his adherents, unless
he had been well assured beforehand, of the co-operation of Lord
Stanley, who was the third husband of his mother. <a
name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a"
class="citation">[162a]</a>&nbsp; Such a course of proceeding, by
Henry, without being previously certain of Lord Stanley&rsquo;s
deserting Richard at a convenient opportunity, would have been an
act of madness.&nbsp; Everything had, no doubt, been arranged
between them before Henry embarked in France.</p>
<p>The fatal error which Richard committed, was previously to the
battle, in intrusting the levying of forces to Lord Stanley, when
he could not confidently trust him: Richard imagined that, by
retaining in his custody George Lord Strange, the son of Lord
Stanley, by way of hostage, he had sufficient security for his
fidelity; but the result showed how frail and deceptive such a
security really was.</p>
<p>Richard, on the 16th of August, led his army from Nottingham
to Leicester, which town he entered with great pomp.&nbsp; On the
17th, he marched from it, expecting to meet his rival at
Hinckley.&nbsp; That night he passed at Emsthorpe, where his
officers slept in the church.&nbsp; On the 18th, he removed to
Stapleton, where he pitched his camp on the ground called
Bradshaws, and remained until Sunday, the 21st, when both armies
came in sight of each other.&nbsp; In the evening, Richard
removed with his forces to Amyon Hill. <a
name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b"
class="citation">[162b]</a>&nbsp; On the 22nd, the battle took
place.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutton states, that &ldquo;the King continued <i>in
battalia</i> near the top of the hill, unwilling to lose his
advantageous ground; <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>while Henry unfurled his banners,
sounded the march of death, and advanced from the meadows
below;&rdquo; <a name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a> also, that Richmond &ldquo;slowly
marched up the ascent, where the wood now stands; the morass
formed by King Richard&rsquo;s Well, being on his right, and the
sun, not on his back, or his right hand, but between both: the
King&rsquo;s troops looking on with their bows bent.&rdquo; <a
name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b"
class="citation">[163b]</a>&nbsp; That account respecting the
position of the sun when the battle commenced, differs in a
slight degree from the accounts of the old historians, who state,
that when Henry left the marsh on his right, he had the sun at
his back, and that it was in the face of his enemies. <a
name="citation163c"></a><a href="#footnote163c"
class="citation">[163c]</a></p>
<p>Those accounts seem to be all that we have to guide us, as to
the precise position of Richard&rsquo;s army, when the battle
commenced; for the old historians have not devoted their
attention to describing it.</p>
<p>The position upon the hill, was certainly, as Mr. Hutton
correctly states, an excellent one, and Henry must have begun the
attack at some disadvantage, for the hill was against him. <a
name="citation163d"></a><a href="#footnote163d"
class="citation">[163d]</a></p>
<p>The old historical writers state, that when Henry marched from
his camp to the attack, he left the morass on his right; <a
name="citation163e"></a><a href="#footnote163e"
class="citation">[163e]</a> which is important, and tends to
confirm the explanation before attempted, respecting the position
of Richard&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; Mr. Hutton mentions, that Henry
advanced from the south end of the field, <a
name="citation163f"></a><a href="#footnote163f"
class="citation">[163f]</a> and that Richard&rsquo;s forces were
posted <i>in battalia</i> upon Amyon Hill. <a
name="citation163g"></a><a href="#footnote163g"
class="citation">[163g]</a>&nbsp; If so, it seems tolerably
clear, that Henry&rsquo;s army faced (as has been already
mentioned) to the north-eastward, and that of Richard to the
south-westward; and it appears naturally to follow, that Richard
had the town of <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Market Bosworth, or the village of Sutton Cheney, or
both of them in his rear, or rather in the rear of his left
wing.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that in Mr. Hutton&rsquo;s plan of the field
of battle, at page 1, Henry&rsquo;s army is drawn, as facing
towards the south-eastward; and Richard&rsquo;s army is
delineated facing towards the north-westward, with Market
Bosworth at a distance, in advance of his right, and with Sutton
Cheney rather to the rear of his right, and with his left
extended towards the well; but with Lord Stanley&rsquo;s forces
interposed between it and the King&rsquo;s army; yet in the other
plan, delineated by Mr. Pridden, and introduced by J. Nichols,
F.S.A., into the work; at page 244, Henry&rsquo;s army is
depicted facing to the north-eastward; and the army of Richard is
delineated as facing to the south-westward (which seems to be
probable), and with Sutton Cheney to the rear of his left, and
with King Richard&rsquo;s Well between the two armies, and rather
before Richard&rsquo;s right centre.</p>
<p>With respect, to the tradition, that Richard quenched his
thirst at the well during the battle, I have merely to remark,
that it was an improbable circumstance to have occurred in such a
place.</p>
<p>In the army of King Richard, the Duke of Norfolk and his son
the Earl of Surrey had the honour of leading the van, consisting
principally of archers; the main body (or main battle, as it was
at that time called) was led by the King in person; and the rear
was commanded by the Earl of Northumberland. <a
name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a></p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>The
van of the Earl of Richmond&rsquo;s army, consisting also
principally of archers, was commanded by the Earl of Oxford, the
main body by the Earl of Richmond and his uncle Jasper Earl of
Pembroke, the right wing by Sir Gilbert Talbot, and the left by
Sir John Savage.</p>
<p>Cannons and other descriptions of firearms, were in common use
by the English in war at that period, and we cannot dispute the
fact of their having been used at the battle of Bosworth, because
we know, from the accounts handed down to us by Philippe de
Commines, the historian, that the King of France, besides
advancing money, furnished the Earl of Richmond with some pieces
of artillery for his expedition against Richard, &ldquo;une bonne
somme d&rsquo;argent, et quelques pieces d&rsquo;artillerie, et
ainsi fut conduict, avec le navire de Normandie, pour descendre
en Galles, dont il estoit;&rdquo; <a name="citation165a"></a><a
href="#footnote165a" class="citation">[165a]</a> besides which,
guns are mentioned in the act of attainder of 1st Henry VII. <a
name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a> passed against the adherents of
Richard who took part in the battle; and cannon balls of a small
size have been dug up upon Bosworth Field. <a
name="citation165c"></a><a href="#footnote165c"
class="citation">[165c]</a></p>
<p>The principal commanders on the part of Richard were, the Duke
of Norfolk <a name="citation165d"></a><a href="#footnote165d"
class="citation">[165d]</a> (slain in the battle), his son the
Earl of Surrey, <a name="citation165e"></a><a

Northumberland, <a name="citation165f"></a><a

name="citation166f"></a><a href="#footnote166f"
class="citation">[166f]</a>&nbsp; All the four last-mentioned
commanders were slain in the battle.</p>
<p>The principal commanders on Henry&rsquo;s part were, the Earl
of Pembroke, <a name="citation166g"></a><a href="#footnote166g"
class="citation">[166g]</a> the Earl of Oxford, <a
name="citation166h"></a><a href="#footnote166h"

name="citation167a"></a><a href="#footnote167a"
class="citation">[167a]</a> <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>who was Henry&rsquo;s
standard-bearer; Sir Gilbert Talbot, <a
name="citation167b"></a><a href="#footnote167b"
class="citation">[167b]</a> of Grafton in Worcestershire; Sir
John Savage, <a name="citation167c"></a><a href="#footnote167c"
class="citation">[167c]</a> Sir John Byron, <a
name="citation167d"></a><a href="#footnote167d"
class="citation">[167d]</a> and, at an opportune time after the
battle had commenced, Lord Stanley. <a name="citation167e"></a><a
href="#footnote167e" class="citation">[167e]</a>&nbsp; The only
person of note of Henry&rsquo;s army who was slain in the battle
was Sir William Brandon, his standard-bearer; and historians
inform us, that he was slain by Richard with his <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>own
hand.&nbsp; Richard made a courageous and intrepid charge <a
name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a> and attempt, with some of his forces,
to cut his way to Henry, and to terminate the battle by
despatching him; and in his charge slew Sir William Brandon, and
unhorsed Sir John Cheney.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s daring enterprise
at first seemed likely to be attended with success, but was
frustrated by Sir William Stanley, <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a> who then
declared for Henry, and threw the weight of 3000 fresh soldiers
into the scale of the latter, and attacked Richard&rsquo;s right
flank.</p>
<p>This appears to have been the important period of the battle
alluded to by Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span><i>Catesby</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Rescue my Lord of
Norfolk!&nbsp; Rescue!&nbsp; Rescue!<br />
The king enacts more wonders than a man,<br />

His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,<br />
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.<br />
Rescue, fair Lord, or else the day is lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakespeare&rsquo;s</span> <i>Richard III.</i>, act
v., scene 4.<br />
(<i>Bosworth Field</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was at a critical moment that Sir William Stanley declared
for Henry, because, if he had deferred his aid a very short time
longer, he might have deferred it for ever; for fortune seemed at
that moment to be propitious to Richard&rsquo;s enterprise and
invincible courage; and Henry was in the utmost danger, and it
was probable that he must either have perished or fled.</p>
<p>The consequence of Sir William Stanley&rsquo;s opportune and
most valuable assistance was, that Richard and most of the
noblemen, knights, and soldiers, who accompanied him in the
charge, were surrounded by superior numbers and slain, and Henry
obtained the victory. <a name="citation169a"></a><a
href="#footnote169a" class="citation">[169a]</a></p>
<p>It is not known with any degree of certainty what the
respective numbers were in the hostile armies, but it is supposed
upon reasonable grounds, that Richard brought into the field
about 12,000 men, that Henry brought 7000, Lord Stanley 5000, and
Sir William Stanley 3000; <a name="citation169b"></a><a
href="#footnote169b" class="citation">[169b]</a> consequently,
Richard&rsquo;s forces were considerably more numerous than his
enemy&rsquo;s at the commencement of the battle; but were
considerably outnumbered by those on the side of Henry, after
Lord Stanley and Sir William Stanley had joined him.&nbsp;
Authors differ very much respecting the number of the slain; some
state it to have been very considerable.&nbsp; Mr. Hutton, on the
contrary, inclines to think that it was only about 900 on both
sides, <a name="citation169c"></a><a href="#footnote169c"
class="citation">[169c]</a> of which by far the greatest carnage
was in the pursuit.&nbsp; Probably his estimate is too low; but,
as the battle did not last very long, <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and as the principal part of
Richard&rsquo;s forces were indifferent or reluctant to fight in
his cause, it may perhaps be reasonably inferred that the slain
did not very greatly exceed that number.&nbsp; Hall, Holinshed,
and Grafton, concur in stating, that the number of the slain was
not much more than 1000, which may probably be correct.</p>
<p>Henry, with great pomp, proceeded the same evening to
Leicester.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s corpse was found amongst the
slain, covered with wounds, dirt, and blood, and was hung
perfectly naked across a horse, the feet dangling on one side and
the hands on the other, behind Blanc Sanglier, pursuivant at
arms, so called from the Boar Argent, the cognizance of Richard,
and was carried in triumph to Leicester that afternoon.&nbsp;
This disgusting spectacle was meant as a disgrace to Richard, but
it was really a disgrace to Henry.&nbsp; Insults offered by the
victor to the corpse of a soldier slain in battle, be he whom he
may, evince a great degree of meanness or cowardice on the part
of the former.&nbsp; The body was exposed to public view during
two days in the Town Hall, and was then interred in the Grey
Friars Church.&nbsp; At the destruction of religious houses, his
remains were turned out of it by the town&rsquo;s people, and
there is reason to believe that they were got rid of, by being
thrown into the river at the end of Bow Bridge, at Leicester;
&ldquo;borne out of the city, and contemptuously bestowed under
the end of Bow Bridge, which giveth passage over a branch of
Stoure, upon the west side of the towne.&rdquo;&mdash;See
Speed&rsquo;s <i>Annals</i>, fo. 936; see also Thorsby&rsquo;s
<i>Views in Leicestershire</i>, p. 338.&nbsp; A stone coffin in
which they had been deposited, was converted into a
watering-trough at the White Horse Inn in Gallow Tree Gate, and
was early in the last century broken to pieces. <a
name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170"
class="citation">[170]</a></p>
<p>Happening to be in Leicester on the 5th of June, 1856, I did
not omit to inquire for the Grey Friars Church; but although I
discovered the street where it had stood, I found that every
vestige of the church had disappeared.</p>
<p>There is a very absurd, but very common mistake, arising from
the ignorance of authors, in stating that Richard wore his royal
crown upon his helmet during the battle.&nbsp; Nothing can be
more erroneous than such a statement.&nbsp; Richard was too old
and experienced a soldier to put such a head-gear upon his <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>helmet; nor
could a real crown screwed to, or fastened upon a helmet, be worn
for any rational purpose, during a battle.&nbsp; He, however,
wore, as a distinguishing mark, and as an emblem of command, a
comparatively small ornament, resembling a crown, upon his
helmet, which was not at all strange or unprecedented; on the
contrary, it was formerly a common practice.&nbsp; King Henry V.
wore a similar ornament upon his helmet at the battle of
Agincourt, in 1415, which was of some use, in sustaining the
stroke of a battle-axe from the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, which
cleft it; and Thomas Duke of Clarence, second son of Henry IV.,
wore a coronet or circlet upon his helmet, when he was fighting
valiantly, and slain at the battle of Baug&eacute; in France, in
1421; besides which, there are many monuments which I have seen
in English cathedrals and churches, where the figures of warriors
and men of rank are represented with ornaments resembling small
crowns or coronets upon their helmets.</p>
<p>The account of the battle, and the description of the field,
having been so fully given in the interesting work already
mentioned, it would be superfluous for me to attempt to go into
further particulars; I may, however, add, that the battle
terminated in the defeat and death of Richard, rather in
consequence of the defection of Lord Stanley and of his brother
Sir William Stanley, and the indifference or disaffection of
others, whom Richard relied upon, than of any valour or skill in
Henry or his army.</p>
<p>Henry was immediately saluted as King of England by his
forces; and, without waiting for the ratification of his claim by
Parliament, or any other recognised authority, assumed the title
of Henry VII.; and, scorning to be less tyrannical or less wicked
than his predecessor, commenced his reign by putting to death,
without any trial, and in cold blood, two days after the battle,
William Catesby, <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> and two gentlemen from the North, of
the <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>name
of Brecher, who had been taken prisoners; and sentencing to
imprisonment for life, in the Tower, an innocent and defenceless
boy, Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, whose only crime was
his being the son of George Duke of Clarence, and the only
surviving male of the royal house of Plantagenet, and whom Henry
very wickedly at last put to death, in 1499.&nbsp; Henry also
caused an act of attainder <a name="citation172a"></a><a
href="#footnote172a" class="citation">[172a]</a> to be passed by
Parliament, shortly after the battle, in which he had a great
number of persons, who had been the subjects and adherents of
Richard III., attainted, and declared guilty of high treason, and
all their lands and possessions confiscated, on the alleged
ground of their support of Richard against Henry, although Henry
had never, previously to the battle of Bosworth, been recognised
as King, nor had he even assumed the royal title or
functions.&nbsp; It was, therefore, not only an iniquitous
proceeding, but was an insult to the understandings of men, to
treat any acts done by any persons in the service of the then
reigning King, at the battle of Bosworth, as treasonable actions,
committed against Henry.&nbsp; Those attainders and
confiscations, affecting as they did the lives and property of
many persons, whom Henry wished to destroy or crush, were acts of
gross despotism and tyranny. <a name="citation172b"></a><a
href="#footnote172b" class="citation">[172b]</a></p>
<p>Many years ago, I saw, in the collection of Colonel Stretton,
of Lenton Priory, in Nottinghamshire, some spurs and bridle-bits,
said to be relics of Bosworth Field; and Grose, in his <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span><i>Military
Antiquities</i>, gives an engraving of a helmet found there. <a
name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a></p>
<p>Many relics of the battle are described in Mr. Hutton&rsquo;s
work, which had been discovered there; besides which, human bones
were found, about four years ago, in cutting a drain in a field,
in front of the farm-house standing upon the slope of the hill,
and called Amyon Hill Farm, mentioned before, belonging to Mr.
Stuart, and occupied by Mr. Bradfield.&nbsp; The field where they
were discovered, adjoins that in which King Richard&rsquo;s Well
is.</p>
<p>Mr. John Rubley informed me, that, not many years ago, he
found a sword-hilt, upon the field of battle, which was
afterwards given to Mr. Stuart.&nbsp; There are also a few relics
of the battle preserved in the Public Museum at Leicester.</p>
<p>Persons desirous of visiting the field of battle, will find it
expedient to go from Atherstone to Shenton, and soon after
passing that village, instead of pursuing the road to Market
Bosworth, to turn off to the right, by the road which leads from
Shenton to Sutton Cheney, until they arrive at a large farm on
the left, called Sutton Field Farm, occupied by Mr. Cooper, a
considerable farmer.&nbsp; They should then turn off to the
right, into a field road (which is passable in a carriage, but is
not a good one for that purpose, and therefore walking is
preferable), which ascends the northward side of Amyon Hill,
frequently mentioned before, and cross its summit; and on the
slope of the hill, on its southward side, is Amyon Hill Farm
(which is upon the field of battle), and close to it, in an
adjoining field, is King Richard&rsquo;s Well.&nbsp; It is
covered in with a small pyramid, built of rough stones, but is
open on its south front; and on the inner wall, opposite to the
open part, is the following inscription, cut in small Roman
characters, from the pen of the reverend and learned Dr.
Parr:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The battle of Bosworth is often called the last of the wars of
York and Lancaster.&nbsp; That is an error.&nbsp; The last battle
in those wars was the battle of Stoke, fought in 1487.</p>
<p>It is a lamentable fact, that deeds of violence and bloodshed,
on a large scale, did not cease in England with the death of the
last Plantagenet King; for during the reign of the two first
Tudor Kings, the crimes and offences disclosed by history, are so
shocking, as to make us amazed at the wickedness and cruelty of
man.</p>
<p>Although the habits and characters of Richard III. and of
Henry VII. were widely different, each was sufficiently
iniquitous in its way; <a name="citation174"></a><a
href="#footnote174" class="citation">[174]</a> and it would be a
task of great difficulty for any well-read historian, to decide
which of those two men was the most wicked.&nbsp; Both of them
were usurpers, and neither of them had any legal right to the
throne; and if they had lived nearer these times, and in humble
life, it is not improbable that the intrepid disposition and
invincible courage of Richard might have made him a daring robber
or highwayman; and the mean and avaricious propensities of Henry,
might have caused him to become an adroit pickpocket or sordid
miser.</p>
<p>It was very much the fashion for historical writers, who lived
in the times of the Tudor sovereigns, in order to court
popularity with them, to calumniate Richard, blacken his memory,
and in <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>their accounts of him, to represent him as a kind of
monster, deformed in person, and malignant in mind, with not a
few other strange assertions, which subsequent generations have
been induced to consider either as absurdities or
exaggerations.</p>
<p>Upon a cool and dispassionate comparison, however, of the
characters of Richard III. and Henry VII., both of them wicked
and unscrupulous men, the contrast is not favourable to
Henry.</p>
<p>Richard committed sanguinary crimes, in order to obtain the
crown; but even his enemies do not accuse him of any tyrannical
or unjust actions, as a King: Henry had not the opportunity of
perpetrating such offences before he obtained the crown; but
history is replete with instances of his tyranny and injustice
during the whole of his life, after he became a King.&nbsp;
Richard possessed great talents, and natural capacity; but his
reign was so short, that he had not many opportunities of
evincing his abilities for exercising the royal functions; yet he
passed some excellent laws for the benefit of his subjects: Henry
was sagacious and clever in many respects, and during his rather
long reign, he also passed some very good laws; but, as has been
correctly observed, his laws were ever calculated with a view to
his own profit; <a name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a> he encouraged commerce, as it improved
his customs, and brought money in to his subjects, which he could
squeeze out at pleasure. <a name="citation175"></a><a
href="#footnote175" class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; Richard was
munificent and liberal: Henry was mean and avaricious.&nbsp;
Richard was bold, enterprising, and courageous: Henry was
timorous, selfish, and cautious.&nbsp; Richard and Henry,
however, closely resembled each other in one respect: each of

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> commencing a description of
the Field of the Battle of Stoke (in Nottinghamshire), it may be
advisable to mention concisely the nature of a very formidable
insurrection, which was suppressed by that battle.</p>
<p>John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, <a
name="citation177b"></a><a href="#footnote177b"
class="citation">[177b]</a> a man of talents, courage, and
enterprise, was a nephew of Edward IV. and of Richard the Third,
and also of Margaret, <a name="citation177c"></a><a
href="#footnote177c" class="citation">[177c]</a> the widow of
Charles the Bold, or the Rash, Duke of Burgundy.&nbsp; Margaret
was an uncompromising <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>and implacable enemy of Henry VII.,
<a name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a"
class="citation">[178a]</a> and in 1487, a formidable conspiracy
was set on foot, by her and the Earl of Lincoln, of which the
object was to raise an insurrection in England against
Henry.&nbsp; It was given out that Edward Earl of Warwick, son of
George Duke of Clarence, and nephew of Edward IV., had effected
his escape, notwithstanding the vigilance of Henry VII., and had
gone abroad; and Lambert Simnel, <a name="citation178b"></a><a
href="#footnote178b" class="citation">[178b]</a> the son of a
joiner, named Thomas Simnel, of Oxford, <a
name="citation178c"></a><a href="#footnote178c"
class="citation">[178c]</a> was tutored by Richard Simons, a
priest of that city, to personate the young prince.</p>
<p>Margaret furnished the Earl of Lincoln with 2000 Germans,
veteran troops, commanded by Martin Swartz, an officer of talents
and experience.&nbsp; With these forces, and with Lambert
accompanying him, the earl landed in Ireland, and Lambert was
soon afterwards crowned as King, in the Cathedral at Dublin.</p>
<p>They remained some short time in Ireland, where the earl
raised a body of Irish forces, and provided transports; and
having at length sailed from Dublin, the Earl landed with his
army, on the 4th of June, <a name="citation178c"></a><a
href="#footnote178c" class="citation">[178c]</a> near Pile of
Foudrey, at Furness, in Lancashire, where Sir Thomas Broughton,
who had become a party to the conspiracy, had considerable
possessions; and the spot near the village of Broughton, where,
according to tradition, they encamped after landing, is even now
called Swart Moor, after the commander of the German
troops.&nbsp; The insurgents were there joined by Sir Thomas
Broughton, and others, with additional forces.</p>
<p>Lord Lovel <a name="citation178d"></a><a href="#footnote178d"
class="citation">[178d]</a> was also a principal mover of the
insurrection; <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>and we are informed by Dugdale, that he accompanied the
Earl of Lincoln from Flanders to Ireland, and afterwards came
over with him and the rest of the insurgents into England.&nbsp;
Whether that was the case, or whether Lord Lovel joined the earl
at the same time that Sir Thomas Broughton did, or afterwards,
during the march of the insurgents, does not seem quite
certain.&nbsp; Writers have differed upon that point; and the act
of attainder <a name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a> against Lord Lovel, does not throw
any light upon it.&nbsp; It is, however, certain, that he joined
the insurgents before the battle of Stoke.</p>
<p>The Earl of Lincoln marched with his forces from Furness into
Yorkshire; and on arriving at Masham, he sent to the mayor of
York, and requested to be admitted into the city, in order to
victual the army. <a name="citation179b"></a><a
href="#footnote179b" class="citation">[179b]</a>&nbsp; This
having been refused, it made a great and serious change, in the
earl&rsquo;s plans and prospects; and it is not improbable, that
it determined him at all hazards, promptly to seek and fight the
King.&nbsp; He then marched from Yorkshire into Nottinghamshire;
but the exact line of march is not known; it may, however, be
fairly concluded, that he took the route by Mansfield.&nbsp; He
proceeded to Southwell, and continued his march in the direction
of the Trent; and he appears to have crossed that river at
Fiskerton, which in the summer time is shallow, and easily
fordable by men and horses.&nbsp; As Newark <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>was
preoccupied by the King&rsquo;s army, Fiskerton was the only safe
place near Southwell, where the earl&rsquo;s forces could pass
the Trent.&nbsp; After crossing the river, they took up a
position on the elevated ground to the southward of, and
overlooking, the little village of East Stoke, in
Nottinghamshire.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the King, apprised of the landing of the
insurgents in Lancashire, assembled a considerable army under the
command of his uncle, Jasper Duke of Bedford (formerly Earl of
Pembroke <a name="citation180a"></a><a href="#footnote180a"
class="citation">[180a]</a>) and John Earl of Oxford; <a
name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"
class="citation">[180b]</a> and with these he marched from
Kenilworth, through Coventry, Leicester, Loughborough, and
Nottingham.&nbsp; The valuable services rendered to Henry by
Thomas, first Earl of Derby (when Lord Stanley <a
name="citation180c"></a><a href="#footnote180c"
class="citation">[180c]</a>), at the battle of Bosworth, were too
important, and too recent, to be forgotten; and the King was, of
course, happy to call for, and avail himself of, his influence on
this occasion.&nbsp; On Corpus Christi Day, the King was joined
at Nottingham by Lord Strange, son of the Earl of Derby, with a
great body of troops, principally consisting of the followers and
tenants of the earl.&nbsp; He was also joined there by the Earl
of Shrewsbury, <a name="citation180d"></a><a href="#footnote180d"
class="citation">[180d]</a> and by several knights and gentlemen,
with additional forces.</p>
<p>The King marched to the village of Ratcliffe, where he passed
the night.&nbsp; From Ratcliffe, he proceeded to Newark, which he
succeeded in occupying before the Earl of Lincoln&rsquo;s forces
could arrive there. <a name="citation180e"></a><a
href="#footnote180e" class="citation">[180e]</a>&nbsp; From
Newark, the King advanced with his army, and took up his position
on the road leading to East Stoke, and about three miles on the
southward side of Newark.</p>
<p>These introductory observations may possibly cause the
positions, which will now be described, of the hostile armies, to
be the more readily understood.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>In
approaching the village of East Stoke, by the foss-way leading
from the southward towards Newark, the road gradually ascends,
until the traveller attains an eminence or hill, distant little
more than half a mile from the village, commanding an extensive
view of Newark and the neighbouring country.&nbsp; Upon its
highest elevation, to the left or west of the foss-road, is a
windmill, in Stoke Fields; and to the right or south-east, is
another mill, in Elston Fields; but both are in the parish of
Stoke: this eminence decreases in height towards the latter mill,
but extends past the former, towards the north-west, and it ends
in a steep cliff, the foot of which is separated from the river
Trent and Fiskerton Ferry, by Stoke Marsh.&nbsp; The marsh is of
narrow width, and the distance is not much more than a quarter of
a mile from the ferry to the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>That part of the hill upon which the mill in Stoke Fields is
erected, was, at the time when I visited the field of battle, and
probably still is, called the Rampire, a name sufficiently
significant, and the inhabitants of its vicinity are in the habit
of pointing it out, as the place where the Earl of
Lincoln&rsquo;s forces were encamped.&nbsp; It is by far the
strongest military position within some miles of the village, and
tallies exactly with the accounts in the old historical
works.&nbsp; This being premised, the earl&rsquo;s centre would
naturally be at the place where the mill is now erected; his
right wing would extend a little way across the foss-road, in the
direction of the other mill standing in Elston Fields; and his
left wing would occupy the strong position on the summit of the
eminence. <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181"
class="citation">[181]</a>&nbsp; The hill rapidly decreases in
height, and slopes down towards Stoke village and the
vicarage-house, which stands in Elston Fields, although in Stoke
parish, close to the village, and about fifty or sixty yards to
the right or east of the foss-road.&nbsp; It was down this slope
that the earl&rsquo;s troops descended to attack the forces of
Henry VII., at the battle of Stoke.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>In
proceeding to describe the situation of Henry&rsquo;s camp, and
to compare the two positions with the accounts given by the old
historians, it is proper to mention, that after passing the
village of Stoke, and at less than half a mile on the foss-road,
towards Newark, and between three and four miles from the latter
town, the road gradually rises until the traveller arrives at the
toll-bar, which is on slightly elevated ground. <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a></p>
<p>From the accounts given by the old historical writers of the
movements of Henry VII., <a name="citation182b"></a><a
href="#footnote182b" class="citation">[182b]</a> there is great
reason to suppose, that at that place, or very near to it, his
forces were encamped previously to the battle of Stoke; and as
the country, between Newark and Stoke, is nearly level, with the
exception of the elevated ground just before mentioned, it was
the only place, three miles from Newark, where eligible rising
ground could be found, to encamp upon, between that town and
Stoke village; and it tallies in its distance from Newark, and
its contiguity to the village of Stoke, with the accounts given
by the old historians.</p>
<p>The two positions above described, correspond in a remarkable
manner, with the accounts of the old annalists and
chroniclers.&nbsp; Polydore Virgil, after describing the Earl of
Lincoln&rsquo;s putting to sea with his forces from Dublin to
England, says, that &ldquo;haud procul Lancastrio in terram
descendunt, freti opibus Thom&aelig; Brogtoni, qui princeps erat
conjurationis socius.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then mentions the course
pursued by Henry, and states, that &ldquo;Comes Lincolniesis
interea Eboracensem agrum ingressus c&ugrave;m sociis, lento
incedebat gradu, ac sine ullo maleficio incolarum, quippe qui
sperabat aliquem populi concursum ad se fieri,&rdquo; and, after
mentioning the earl&rsquo;s reasons for venturing upon a battle,
he proceeds as follows: &ldquo;ex agro Eboracensi Neuuarcum
versus iter facere c&oelig;pit, ut ibi auctis copiis, in regem,
quem venire obviam, <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>&amp; vix bidui abesse intellexerat,
recta via contenderet.&nbsp; C&aelig;ter&#363; priusquam ille
e&ograve; perveniret, Henricus cui nulla hora operis comitis erat
ignota, sub vesper&#363; illius diei, qui ante pr&aelig;lii diem
illuxit, celerius opinione eorum, obviam venientibus factus,
Neuuarcum accessit, parumque illic moratus, tria millia passuum
progressus est, ibique positis castris pernoctavit.&nbsp; Comes
ver&ograve; cognito regis adventu nihil territus inc&oelig;ptum
iter continuat, eodemque die pervenit ad viculum proximum
adversariorum castris, quem voc&#257;t Stochum, e&ocirc;q&ucirc;e
loci castra facit.&nbsp; Postero die rex ex omnibus copiis
triplici instructa acie, Stochum proficiscitur, ac prope castra
comitis consistit, atque facit &aelig;quo in loco pugnandi
potestatem.&nbsp; Potestate facta, comes copias educit, signoque
suis dato, in certamen desc&#275;dit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Polydore Virgil wrote in the reign of King Henry VIII.,
numbers of persons present at the battle, must have been living,
from whom he probably obtained information.</p>
<p>Hall also wrote in the reign of King Henry VIII., and died
soon after the accession of King Edward VI.&nbsp; In his
<i>Chronicles</i>, the mentions, that the Earl of Lincoln and his
troops landed &ldquo;at the Pyle of Fowdrey, within lytle of
Lancastre;&rdquo; that he marched into Yorkshire, and afterwards
&ldquo;directed his waye from Yorke to Newarke-upo&rsquo;-Trent,
to thentent that there he (as he trusted) augme&rsquo;tyng hys
co&rsquo;paigny might set upon the Kyng, who&rsquo; he knew to be
but II daies jorney from him.&nbsp; Albeit, before he came there,
Kyng Henry was in his bosome, and knewe every houre what the erle
did, came the night before that he fought, to Newarke, and there
approched nere hys enemyes soner then they loked for him, and
there tariyng a lytle, went III myles further and pitched his
feelde, and lodged there that night.&nbsp; The Erle of Lyncolne
certefyed of his commyng was nothynge afearde, but kepte styll on
hys jorney, and, at a lytle village called Stoke, nygh to the
Kyng and hys army, planted hys campe.&nbsp; The next daye
followynge the Kynge devyded hys whole nombre into three
battailes, and after in good arraye approched nigh to the toune
of Stoke, where was an equall and <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>playne place for bothe parties to
arreigne the battaile.&nbsp; When the place was apoynted and
ordeined to trye the bittermost by stroke of battaile, the erle
set furth his army, and, gevyng a token to his compaignye, set
upon his adversaries with a manly courage, desirynge his
souldyours that daye to remembre his honoure and their awne
lyves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holinshed&rsquo;s account, in his <i>Chronicles</i>, written
in the reign of Elizabeth, is nearly in the same words.</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor Bacon (Viscount St. Alban&rsquo;s), in his
<i>Life of King Henry VII.</i>, as given in Kennet&rsquo;s
<i>Lives</i>, says, that the Earl of Lincoln &ldquo;march&rsquo;d
towards Newark, thinking to have surprised the town.&nbsp; But
the King was somewhat before this time come to Nottingham,&rdquo;
and, a battle being resolved upon in his council,
&ldquo;march&rsquo;d speedily, so as he put himself between the
enemies&rsquo; camp and Newark, being loth their army should get
the commodity of that town.&nbsp; The earl, nothing
dismay&rsquo;d, came forwards that day unto a little village
call&rsquo;d Stoke, and there encamp&rsquo;d that night upon the
brow or hanging of a hill.&nbsp; The King, the next day,
presented him battel upon the plain, the fields being open and
champion.&nbsp; The earl courageously came down, and joyned
battel with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Stow&rsquo;s <i>Annals</i>, it is stated, that &ldquo;the
Earl of Lincolne, being entered into Yorkeshire, directed his way
to Newark-upon-Trent, and, at a little village called Stoke,
three or four miles from Newarke, nigh to the King and his army,
planted his campe.&nbsp; The next day following, the King divided
his number into three battells, and after approched nigh the
towne of Stoke, where both the armies joined and fought
egerly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speed says, that &ldquo;the King dislodgeth with his army, and
passeth thorow Newarke, leaving it behind him about three
miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, &ldquo;the next day, both the armies
are brought forth to fight neere to a little village called
Stoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also adverts to the earl&rsquo;s having
marshalled his men &ldquo;upon the brow or hanging of an
hill,&rdquo; before the battle.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Baker, in his <i>Chronicles</i>, mentions the
earl&rsquo;s <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;taking his way from York to
Newark-upon-Trent.&nbsp; King Henry, understanding which way he
took, came the night before the battel to Newark, and, going
three miles further, near to a village called Stoke, there waited
the approach of the Earl of Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, I learnt, that human bones, coins, and other
relics indicative of a battle, have been frequently dug up in the
fields, on the south side of the village, which are exactly
where, from the above accounts, it is to be presumed, the
earl&rsquo;s centre was engaged, after descending from his strong
post, and which lie at the foot of the eminence, above described;
and also on the south side of and within the garden of Sir Robert
Bromley, Bart., which would be the position of the earl&rsquo;s
left wing when fighting.&nbsp; They have also been found in
digging the foundations of some walls near the vicarage, in
Elston Fields, where the King&rsquo;s left wing would be
engaged.</p>
<p>In August 1825, Sir Robert Bromley kindly accompanied me over
part of the field of battle, and pointed out a place in his
garden, where the remains of many of the slain were found.&nbsp;
They were interred in long trenches; but very few indications of
armour or weapons were discovered; however, the labourers found
two spurs: one of which they purloined, the other Sir Robert
Bromley obtained.&nbsp; He kindly allowed me to inspect it.&nbsp;
It is of silver on the outside, and of steel within, and is of
considerable beauty and elegance of workmanship.&nbsp; It is of
very small size, and remarkable for the appropriate nature of its
ornaments&mdash;roses boldly embossed on its surface.&nbsp; It
bears a strong resemblance to the one dug up on Bosworth Field,
of which an engraving is given in Hutton&rsquo;s <i>Bosworth
Field</i>.</p>
<p>Those who wish for an account of the march and movements of
Henry previously to the battle, will find it in the journal said
to have been kept by the herald, <a name="citation185a"></a><a
href="#footnote185a" class="citation">[185a]</a> who accompanied
his army.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s proclamation, <a
name="citation185b"></a><a href="#footnote185b"
class="citation">[185b]</a> for enforcing discipline and order on
the <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>march, is curious, and gives us some idea of the
insubordination of an English army, at that period.</p>
<p>The principal commanders in Henry&rsquo;s army, were, Jasper
Duke of Bedford, <a name="citation186a"></a><a
href="#footnote186a" class="citation">[186a]</a> John Earl of
Oxford, <a name="citation186b"></a><a href="#footnote186b"
class="citation">[186b]</a> George Earl of Shrewsbury; <a
name="citation186c"></a><a href="#footnote186c"
class="citation">[186c]</a> Richard Neville, Lord Latimer, <a
name="citation186d"></a><a href="#footnote186d"
class="citation">[186d]</a> Edward Lord Hastings; <a
name="citation186e"></a><a href="#footnote186e"
class="citation">[186e]</a> George Lord Strange, son of Thomas
Earl of Derby; <a name="citation186f"></a><a href="#footnote186f"
class="citation">[186f]</a> Sir John Cheney, and Sir Edward
Fielding. <a name="citation186g"></a><a href="#footnote186g"
class="citation">[186g]</a>&nbsp; Thomas Brandon, brother of Sir
William Brandon <a name="citation186h"></a><a
href="#footnote186h" class="citation">[186h]</a> (who was the
standard-bearer of Henry, and was slain at the battle of
Bosworth), had the honour of bearing Henry&rsquo;s shield at the
battle of Stoke. <a name="citation186i"></a><a
href="#footnote186i" class="citation">[186i]</a></p>
<p>The Earl of Lincoln and his forces being posted upon the hill,
Henry, on the 16th of June, 1487, <a name="citation186j"></a><a
href="#footnote186j" class="citation">[186j]</a> drew up his army
in three lines, in the open space to the southward or south-east
of Stoke, and offered the earl battle, which the latter,
notwithstanding the disparity of their forces, courageously
accepted.</p>

<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>The
act of attainder <a name="citation187a"></a><a
href="#footnote187a" class="citation">[187a]</a> passed against
the earl and his adherents, furnishes some evidence of guns
having been used by the earl&rsquo;s forces; as the act states
them to have been armed with &ldquo;swerdys, speris, marespikes,
bowes, gonnes, harneys, brigandines, hawberkes, and many other
weapyns and harneys.&rdquo;&nbsp; If, as that act seems to state,
the earl had artillery with his army, which were used at the
battle, they would naturally be placed, on the slope of the hill
before described, and would be fired from thence upon the royal
army drawn up on the lower ground.</p>
<p>The earl descended the hill, with his troops in good order,
and attacked the royalists with great intrepidity, in hopes,
that, by breaking their first line, the fugitives from it, would
fall back upon those in the rear, and throw them into confusion;
but, after bravely fighting for three hours, during which, the
half-naked Irish, undisciplined, and only armed with darts and
skins, obstinately maintained their ground, although
Henry&rsquo;s archers kept constantly thinning their ranks, and
the English and Germans fought with the utmost valour, they were
totally routed, with great slaughter.&nbsp; The Earl of Lincoln,
Lord Kildare (or, as several authors call him, Lord Thomas
Gerardine or Fitzgerald), Sir Thomas Broughton; Martin Swartz,
the commander of the foreign auxiliaries; and most of the other
leaders of the earl&rsquo;s party, died sword in hand. <a
name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b"
class="citation">[187b]</a>&nbsp; The impostor, Lambert Simnel,
and the priest his tutor, were taken prisoners, <a
name="citation187c"></a><a href="#footnote187c"
class="citation">[187c]</a> and Lord Lovel was never afterwards
heard of; it has been said, that in endeavouring to escape by
crossing the Trent, he was drowned in the river.&nbsp; Some
writers state, that he was slain in the battle; but in the
account given in the before-mentioned <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>journal, he is said to have been
&ldquo;put to flight&rdquo; [escaped]. <a
name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; Whether he perished in crossing
the Trent, fell in the battle, or fled, and contrived to secrete
himself, so as to elude discovery, will probably never be
satisfactorily ascertained. <a name="citation188b"></a><a
href="#footnote188b" class="citation">[188b]</a>&nbsp; He had
been a steadfast supporter of King Richard III., at whose
coronation, he had the honour of carrying one of the pointed
swords on the King&rsquo;s left hand; <a
name="citation188c"></a><a href="#footnote188c"
class="citation">[188c]</a> and was made Lord Chamberlain, and he
had also fought for him at Bosworth Field. <a
name="citation188d"></a><a href="#footnote188d"
class="citation">[188d]</a>&nbsp; His enmity to Henry VII.
induced him to join the insurrection of Sir Humphrey Stafford,
and his brother, Thomas Stafford, in 1486, and take up arms in
Yorkshire, whilst they prepared to attack Worcester; but, his
troops dispersing, he was obliged to fly to Furness, in
Lancashire, where Sir Thomas Broughton received and afforded him
an asylum, and from thence he proceeded into Flanders, to
Margaret Duchess of Burgundy. <a name="citation188e"></a><a
href="#footnote188e" class="citation">[188e]</a></p>
<p>Many of the Earl of Lincoln&rsquo;s forces were destroyed in
their flight from the field, and in attempting to escape over the
Trent, by Fiskerton Ferry.&nbsp; A ravine or gully, which
descends from the high ground on the south-west side of the
cliff, is now pointed out, as being the place through which the
fugitives endeavoured to pass, in order to get to the ferry, and
which, tradition says, ran with blood, and where a great
slaughter was inflicted upon them.&nbsp; It is from that
circumstance, called Red Gutter; and human bones, and other
<i>indicia</i> of slaughter, have been dug up in it.&nbsp; It is
rather difficult of access at present, <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>from being
covered with a plantation of trees; but there is still a path
through it, and it opens upon Stoke Marsh, about thirty or forty
yards to the southward of the modern road leading over the marsh,
to the ferry; towards which the fugitives would naturally
endeavour to pass through this ravine, as the steepness of the
cliff would render it difficult, in most places, to descend in
any other direction; and the contiguity of the right wing of the
royal army would prevent a retreat over the flat ground by the
high road past the church to the ferry.&nbsp; The Trent, in the
summer time, and the battle was fought in the month of June, is
fordable for horses and men, and, as far as I could judge by the
eye, it is thereabouts one hundred and sixty or one hundred and
eighty yards wide; and if the wreck of the defeated army could
have gained the opposite bank, it would have furnished some
chance of escape, in comparative safety.</p>
<p>That the hill in Stoke Fields above described, is that on
which the Earl of Lincoln was encamped, seems to be
satisfactorily proved, independently of tradition, from the
circumstance, that when he entered Nottinghamshire from
Yorkshire, and marched towards Newark-on-Trent, as stated in
Leland&rsquo;s <i>Collectanea</i>, <a name="citation189"></a><a
href="#footnote189" class="citation">[189]</a> &ldquo;Enemyes and
rebelles drew towards Newarke warde, passing by Southwelle and
the Furside of Trente,&rdquo; he found the castle and town of
Newark preoccupied by his enemy, in which Hall, Holinshed,
Polydore Virgil, Bacon, Speed, and Baker, all agree, and he could
not well get to Stoke, without passing through, or close to,
Southwell, and then crossing the Trent: and the ford and ferry
nearest to Southwell, and to those parts of the country through
which he is said to have marched, is Fiskerton; which is close
under the hill.&nbsp; Besides which, the hill is by far the
strongest military position in that part of the country: in fact,
the cliff occupied, as before observed, by his left wing, was
almost inassailable; and the parts of the hill where his centre
and right were posted, must have been <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>exceedingly difficult of approach by
hostile forces, because they would labour under the disadvantage
of having to ascend an eminence, probably strengthened by
artificial defences and by the natural obstacles of brushwood and
other inconveniences incident to uncultivated ground.&nbsp; It is
the only elevated ground near Stoke, of sufficient elevation to
warrant the word &ldquo;descends,&rdquo; used by Polydore Virgil,
&ldquo;Comes copias educit, signoque suis dato in certamen
descendit;&rdquo; and, after a very careful survey of the country
for miles round Stoke, no other eminence presents itself worthy
of Bacon&rsquo;s appellation, &ldquo;the brow or hanging of a
hill,&rdquo; or to which his words &ldquo;came down&rdquo; can
apply, &ldquo;the earl courageously came down and joyned battel
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bones, coins, and other relics, which have been dug up,
show that the conflict took place at the spot before mentioned,
near the village, and close to, and in the garden of Sir Robert
Bromley, Bart., in Stoke Fields, and also upon a small portion of
Elston Fields. <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a></p>
<p>A great part of the church has evidently been rebuilt, and,
except a Gothic arch communicating from the tower to the body of
the church, it has not many claims to antiquity.&nbsp; A few
brick and slated cottages have of late years been built amongst
the others, in the village; but its appearance conveys to the
spectator, the idea of its having undergone little change for
centuries past.</p>
<p>The places where the human bones, &amp;c. &amp;c. have been
dug up, show that the village of Stoke, previous to the battle,
was occupied by part of Henry&rsquo;s forces, because, as it was
the Earl of Lincoln who commenced the attack, it is obvious,
that, if the village had been occupied by his troops, the battle
would have been fought on the north or the north-east side, and
not to the southward of the village; besides which, that idea
receives corroboration <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>from the expression of Polydore
Virgil, in reference to Henry&rsquo;s
movements:&mdash;&ldquo;Stochum proficiscitur, ac prope castra
comitis consistit.&rdquo; <a name="citation191a"></a><a
href="#footnote191a" class="citation">[191a]</a>&nbsp; Henry
could not have drawn his forces out of the village, and
approached the camp of the earl, if the former had not
preoccupied the village.</p>
<p>This memorable battle was the last that was fought between the
adherents to the rival Houses of York and Lancaster (that in
1485, called Bosworth Field, being often erroneously so
considered), in which one of the House of York attempted, by
arms, to obtain the crown; and it firmly secured the House of
Tudor upon the throne of England.&nbsp; The victory was, however,
purchased by a lamentable destruction of human life: about 4000
of the insurgents, and half of the van of the royal forces, are
said to have perished there; probably a total loss of from 5000
to 6000 lives.</p>
<p>What consequences would have ensued to England, if the earl
had been victorious, though it may be amusing to speculate upon
them, it is, of course, impossible to form a reasonable
conjecture.&nbsp; He had claims to the crown, according to the
laws and constitution, in due course, after the daughters of King
Edward the Fourth (supposing the attainders <a
name="citation191b"></a><a href="#footnote191b"
class="citation">[191b]</a> of George Duke of Clarence, and Sir
Thomas Saint Ledger, to be valid, and to exclude their issue),
from his being the eldest son of John de la Pole, Duke of
Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, <a name="citation191c"></a><a
href="#footnote191c" class="citation">[191c]</a> second sister of
King Edward IV. and Richard III., and daughter of Richard Duke of
York.&nbsp; He is described as one who possessed talents and
courage; and he was encouraged by the known intentions <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>of his
uncle, King Richard III., who had declared him successor to the
crown, <a name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a> in case that monarch should die
without issue; and at his coronation the earl had the honour of
carrying the ball and cross, whilst the sceptre was confided to
his father, the Duke of Suffolk. <a name="citation192b"></a><a
href="#footnote192b" class="citation">[192b]</a></p>
<p>It is very clear, that the earl was not at the battle of
Bosworth, fighting on the side of his uncle, not only from the
total silence of historians, <a name="citation192c"></a><a
href="#footnote192c" class="citation">[192c]</a> but from the
fact, that his name does not appear in the list of noblemen,
knights, and gentlemen, who were attainted, <a
name="citation192d"></a><a href="#footnote192d"
class="citation">[192d]</a> when Henry VII. called a Parliament,
for taking a part in that battle; and also from the fact of his
being one of the nobles allowed to attend a council of Henry VII.
<a name="citation192e"></a><a href="#footnote192e"
class="citation">[192e]</a>&nbsp; He appears not to have acted
with sincerity, when he could so far demean himself, as to bring
the impostor, Lambert Simnel, forward as a stalking-horse; and,
in the words of Bacon, &ldquo;neither did the earl refrain the
business, for that he knew the pretended Plantagenet to be but an
idol.&nbsp; But contrariwise, he was more glad it should be the
false Plantagenet than the true; because, the false being sure to
fall away of himself, and the true to be made sure of by the
King, it might open and pave a fair and prepared way to his own
title.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must have been aware of the imposture, and
appears to have been actively concerned in the insurrection, with
the intention of benefiting himself, and the hope of successfully
advancing his own claims to the crown.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, that, at the time of the Earl
of Lincoln&rsquo;s death, his grandmother, Cecily Duchess of
York, was still living; a woman who was doomed to witness, in her
<a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>own
family, more appalling and extraordinary calamities and
vicissitudes, than are to be found in the history of any
individual allied to any of the other royal families of Europe; I
might, perhaps, even be allowed to go further, and to state, in
the known history of any other human being.</p>

great-niece, having previously died, as was suspected, by poison;
her son-in-law, Charles Duke of Burgundy, called Charles the
Bold, or Charles the Rash, who married Margaret, her third
daughter, after having by his folly and rashness, impaired his
power, and placed his dominions in a state of great peril, was
slain at the battle of Nancy, in 1476&ndash;7; her eldest son,
King Edward IV., abandoned a warlike and active life for pleasure

the Tower of London, during her husband&rsquo;s exile; her
son-in-law, Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, who married her

Lancaster, lived for some time in exile, and was in such poverty,
as to be obliged to beg his bread, and in 1473, his corpse was
found stripped naked, on the seashore, near Dover; her two
grandsons, King Edward V. and Richard Duke of York, are believed
to have been murdered <a name="citation195a"></a><a

London, in 1483; her son-in-law, Sir Thomas St. Ledger, who
married Anne, widow of Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter, was
executed in 1483, at Exeter, and attainted for treason, in
joining the unsuccessful rebellion of Henry Stafford, Duke of
Buckingham; and the latter, who was her great-nephew, being the
grandson of her sister, Anne Neville, being deserted by his
forces, and betrayed, was, about the same time, taken prisoner
and beheaded; her grandson, Edward Prince of Wales, son of King
Richard III. and of her <a name="page196"></a><span

whom she naturally expected the honour of being the ancestress of
a line of English Monarchs, died in 1484; and the childless
Queen, his mother, a few months afterwards, followed him to the
tomb; her youngest son, King Richard III., was slain at the
battle of Bosworth, in 1485; and her grandson, John de la Pole,
Earl of Lincoln, perished in 1487, at the battle of Stoke. <a

class="citation">[196a]</a></p>
<p>She died in 1495; <a name="citation196b"></a><a

princes descended from her, had succeeded to the crown of
England, without taking into the account her grand-daughter,
Elizabeth, Queen of Henry VII., and more than one had been
murdered; and, by her death, was saved the additional affliction
of the loss of her grandson, Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick,
the last male of the House of Plantagenet, who was tyrannically
and wickedly put to death, in 1499, by Henry VII.</p>
<p>On a reference to the following Pedigrees, although they only
give some portions of the descents and alliances of the
illustrious Houses of Plantagenet and Neville, the reader will
observe the degree of consanguinity or connection in which each
of the before-mentioned distinguished but unfortunate personages
stood, with reference to Cecily Duchess of York.&nbsp; It would
be foreign to the object of this work, and would be an
undertaking of great labour and difficulty, to give on a more
extensive scale, the pedigrees of either of those Houses.</p>
<p>After perusing such a list of frightful calamities, occurring
in the lifetime of a single individual, to the members of her own
family, the reader may rejoice in living in a civilized age,
under the mild and gentle sway of a Sovereign of the House of
Brunswick, and may well exclaim of the Duchess of York, in the <a

Voltaire, whilst narrating the misfortunes of the Royal House of

FIELD OF THE BATTLE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
EVESHAM.</h2>
<p>As the battle of Evesham was not fought in the fifteenth
century and had no relation to the wars of York and Lancaster, it
would not have been noticed here, if it had not been for the
circumstance of my having visited the field of battle a few
months before this work was sent to the press.&nbsp; Very little
information, however, respecting that sanguinary conflict, can be
obtained by inquiry upon the spot.</p>
<p>On the 28th and 29th of May, 1856, I visited the field of
battle, which was fought on the 4th of August, 1265, between the
forces of King Henry III., under the command of his eldest son
Prince Edward, and those of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester,
and the rebellious barons, and terminated in the defeat of the
latter with great slaughter.</p>
<p>The battle was fought in the spot now enclosed fields, upon
the elevated tract of ground, adjoining the turnpike road from
Evesham in Worcestershire, to Alcester and Warwick, very near a
house called Battle-well House (which stands on the left side of
the road in going from Evesham), and also near the tollbar,
called Battle-well Gate, and almost a mile and a quarter from
Evesham.</p>
<p>A lane turns off from the turnpike road near the tollbar,
towards the river Avon, by which the defeated forces are said to
have fled, and to have attempted to descend to the meadows, in
order to cross the Avon, at a place now called Offenham
Ferry.&nbsp; The lane was, until about 1741, the great high road
from Worcester towards London.&nbsp; An old man, named Thomas
Price, who lives at the lodge of the mansion belonging to Mrs.
Blainey, which is situated on the side of <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>the
turnpike road, opposite to Battle-well House, and, consequently,
upon the spot where the conflict took place, and who has resided
there most of his life, informed me, that many years ago, he
recollected seeing a battle-axe, which, with some human bones,
had been ploughed up in a field, close to Battle-well
House.&nbsp; A bridge is said to have formerly stood at Offenham
Ferry, and some appearances of masonry, seemingly of the pier of
the bridge, may still be discovered at the ferry.&nbsp; Close to
it the ground is a little raised, and that spot is called
&ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Height,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s
Bank,&rdquo; where human remains and fragments of weapons, are
said to have been formerly discovered, as well as in an orchard
very near there, called &ldquo;Twyners.&rdquo;&nbsp; About two
miles on the opposite side of the ferry, is a stone quarry upon a
hill, at South Littleton, which was also in the line of retreat,
and human bones, and parts of weapons, are said to have been
found there, about thirty years ago.</p>
<p>In the beautiful grounds of E. T. Rudge, Esq., of Abbey Manor,
near the field of battle, a small pillar has been erected with

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Battle of Barnet was fought on
the 14th of April, 1471, at a place formerly called Gladmore
Heath, but which is now completely enclosed, about a mile
north-west from Barnet, in the county of Middlesex, between the
Yorkists, under King Edward IV., and the Lancastrians, commanded
by Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, <a name="citation205"></a><a
href="#footnote205" class="citation">[205]</a> the King-Maker, in
which the latter was slain, and the Yorkists were completely
victorious.</p>
<p>I visited the field of battle on the 9th of July, 1856.&nbsp;
The accounts of the battle given by the old historical writers
are so imperfect, that they do not throw any light upon the
precise positions which the hostile armies respectively occupied;
and I could not, when upon the spot, obtain much new information
of moment, relative to the battle.</p>
<p>After Edward IV. had returned from the Continent, and had
landed at Ravenspur, in Yorkshire, he proceeded to York, and from
thence <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>towards London; and the Earl of Warwick, who was posted
with his forces at Coventry, marched from it in pursuit of
him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Warwick</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I will away towards
Barnet presently,<br />
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dars&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakespeare&rsquo;s</span> <i>Henry VI.</i> part
iii. act v. scene 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Earl of Warwick expected that the city of London would
hold out against Edward, until he could arrive to its
relief.&nbsp; On his march, he received the disastrous tidings,
that Edward had been joyfully received into London; that Henry
VI. was a prisoner; and that Warwick&rsquo;s son-in-law, George
Duke of Clarence, <a name="citation206a"></a><a
href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a> had renounced
his engagements, and had gone over, near the town of Warwick,
with all his forces, to Edward.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick was now in a situation of great peril,
and, under other circumstances, would probably have attempted a
retreat, but he was in the face of a superior army, and was some
days&rsquo; march from any place of safety; he was too far
advanced to retreat; and, although Clarence offered his mediation
between Edward and Warwick, the latter proudly rejected it, and
resolutely prepared for battle.</p>
<p>Edward had the superiority of numbers, as his army had become
greatly increased, since Clarence had deserted the Earl of
Warwick, and had joined the Yorkists.</p>
<p>During the night preceding the battle, the Earl of Warwick and
the Lancastrians were encamped on Gladmore Heath, on the
north-westward side of Barnet, and they had posted a small
advanced guard in that town.&nbsp; Edward, having advanced from
London to Barnet, dislodged the few Lancastrian forces posted in
it, and drove them towards the main body; he, however, did not
suffer his men to remain in the town, but encamped in the open
field, nearer his enemies than they were aware; and one old
writer states, that he caused his people to keep as silent as
possible, in order to prevent the Lancastrians from knowing the
exact position of his army. <a name="citation206b"></a><a
href="#footnote206b" class="citation">[206b]</a></p>
<p>Both parties used artillery; <a name="citation206c"></a><a
href="#footnote206c" class="citation">[206c]</a> and some
historians state, <a name="citation206c"></a><a
href="#footnote206c" class="citation">[206c]</a> that they <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>fired at
each other, in the course of the night.&nbsp; We are also told,
that the guns of the Earl of Warwick, were constantly fired at
Edward&rsquo;s forces during the night, but with little effect,
in consequence of overshooting them, from their lying nearer than
was supposed. <a name="citation207a"></a><a href="#footnote207a"
class="citation">[207a]</a></p>
<p>On Easter Sunday, the 14th of April, 1471, the day commenced
with a thick fog, and both armies were placed in order of
battle.&nbsp; On Edward&rsquo;s part, the van was commanded by
Richard Duke of Gloucester; <a name="citation207b"></a><a
href="#footnote207b" class="citation">[207b]</a> the middle, by
Edward in person, assisted by the Duke of Clarence (having with
them King Henry as a prisoner); and the rear was under the
command of Lord Hastings; <a name="citation207c"></a><a
href="#footnote207c" class="citation">[207c]</a> besides which,
Edward had a considerable body of men in reserve.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick gave the command of the Lancastrian right
wing, which consisted of horse, to his brother, the Marquis
Montague, <a name="citation207d"></a><a href="#footnote207d"
class="citation">[207d]</a> and the Earl of Oxford; <a
name="citation207e"></a><a href="#footnote207e"
class="citation">[207e]</a> the left wing, also consisting in a
great measure of horse, was under the command of the Earl of
Warwick and the Duke of Exeter; <a name="citation207f"></a><a
href="#footnote207f" class="citation">[207f]</a> and the middle,
which consisted principally of archers and bill-men, was
commanded by the Duke of Somerset. <a name="citation207g"></a><a
href="#footnote207g" class="citation">[207g]</a></p>
<p>The battle commenced very early in the morning, Edward having
between four and five o&rsquo;clock, advanced his banners, and
caused his trumpets to sound for battle; and as soon as the
opposite forces got sight of each other, the conflict commenced
with archery, and they shortly afterwards, encountered each other
with hand blows.&nbsp; In consequence of the fog, the armies were
inadvertently not drawn up exactly opposite each other; the Earl
of Warwick&rsquo;s right wing, under the command of the Earl of
Oxford, extending a little beyond Edward&rsquo;s left, which
stood to the westward; and in consequence of it, that part of his
army was rather overmatched; <a name="citation207h"></a><a
href="#footnote207h" class="citation">[207h]</a> and we may
readily believe, <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>that from the same cause, Edward&rsquo;s right wing
outflanked Warwick&rsquo;s left.&nbsp; By reason of that
circumstance, and the fierceness and intrepidity, with which the
Earl of Oxford attacked his enemies, he had at first a
considerable degree of success; he broke a part of the ranks of
the Yorkists, and several of the fugitives fled to London, and
gave out that the Lancastrians were victorious.&nbsp; This,
however, proved to be of no eventual advantage, and gave no
encouragement to the other forces of Warwick, because the fog
prevented their being fully aware of it; beside which, some of
Oxford&rsquo;s men commenced pillaging, instead of following up
their first success.&nbsp; An unfortunate mistake also occurred
in consequence of the fog: the device of the Earl of Oxford, a
star with rays, being mistaken for that of Edward, the sun in
splendour; <a name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208"
class="citation">[208]</a> and the Lancastrian archers shot at
Oxford&rsquo;s troops, which caused Oxford and many of his men to
suppose it to be the effect of treachery, and to quit the
field.</p>
<p>The Duke of Gloucester gave proofs of the undaunted courage
and daring spirit, for which he was always conspicuous, and which
his enemies have never ventured to deny; he fought valiantly
against the Lancastrians; and his two esquires, John Milwater and
Thomas Parr, were slain at his feet.</p>
<p>Warwick, at the head of his troops, attacked the part of the
Yorkist army, in which Edward was; and the battle was for a long
time, obstinate and bloody.&nbsp; Edward, however, brought up his
reserve at an opportune moment, and at length, the Earl of
Warwick was slain, and a complete victory was obtained by Edward,
over the Lancastrians.&nbsp; John Neville, Marquis Montague, and
several knights, of whom Sir William Tyrrel was one, also
perished.&nbsp; The Duke of Exeter was wounded, and left for dead
upon the field, from seven in the morning, until four in the
afternoon, when he was brought to the house of one of his
servants named Ruthland, where he was attended by a surgeon; he
was conveyed to sanctuary at Westminster, and afterwards went
abroad.&nbsp; The Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Oxford fled,
in the company of some northern men, towards Scotland; but
changing their plans, Somerset made for Wales, in order to join
Jasper Earl of Pembroke; and Oxford escaped to France, from
whence, he not long afterwards returned, with some men, and
seized the fortress of St. Michael&rsquo;s <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Mount, on
the coast of Cornwall, which he held for several months, against
King Edward&rsquo;s forces.</p>
<p>On King Edward&rsquo;s side, there were slain, Lord Cromwell;
<a name="citation209a"></a><a href="#footnote209a"
class="citation">[209a]</a> Lord Saye; <a
name="citation209b"></a><a href="#footnote209b"

Lord Berners; <a name="citation209c"></a><a href="#footnote209c"
class="citation">[209c]</a> Sir John Lisle; <a
name="citation209d"></a><a href="#footnote209d"
class="citation">[209d]</a> and about 1500 men; but the loss on
the Lancastrian side is said to have amounted to about double
that number, Edward having given orders not to give any
quarter.&nbsp; Most of the slain were buried on the plain where
they had fallen, and where, according to Stow, a chapel was
afterwards built, in memory of them, of which <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>there are
now no remains; but he states, that when he wrote, it was a
dwelling-house, and the upper portions remained.&nbsp; Some of
the bodies of the persons who had been of a higher rank, are said
to have been removed, and interred in the church in Austin
Friars, London.</p>
<p>The bodies of the Earl of Warwick, and the Marquis Montague,
were conveyed in a cart to London, and for three days lay in
Saint Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral Church, with their faces exposed to
view, so that no person could doubt their deaths; and they were
then buried with their ancestors, in Bisham Abbey, in Berkshire,
where they remained until the dissolution of monasteries, when
the abbey was destroyed, and all knowledge of the exact spots
where they were interred, is now forgotten.</p>
<p>Such was the end of the career of the great, valiant, and
powerful Earl of Warwick, who has been not incorrectly described
as the &ldquo;proud setter-up and puller-down of Kings,&rdquo; <a
name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a"
class="citation">[210a]</a> and who had been mainly instrumental
in dethroning Henry VI. and making Edward IV. a King; and again,
in dethroning Edward, and restoring Henry.</p>

<p>From the accounts given by the old historians, <a

class="citation">[210b]</a> it is clear that cannons or some
other description of firearms were used at the battle of
Barnet.&nbsp; Besides which, W. Hutton, F.S.A., states that the

preserved a ball of a pound and a half weight, which he dug out
of the ground. <a name="citation210c"></a><a href="#footnote210c"

Hatfield.</p>
<p>It stood originally close to the tavern called the Two

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a fact admitted by
historians, that in the reign of King Edward III., the English,
not unfrequently, made use of cannons in sieges, during their
wars with the French; but whether they <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>ever used
them in the open field, in the fourteenth century, as has been
asserted, is a point which may well be doubted.</p>
<p>History is replete with instances of the extreme caution and
reluctance, with which the English adopt innovations upon ancient
customs, even when recommended by the probability of
improvement.&nbsp; Their implicit belief in the excellence of the
long bow, and the proud recollection of the splendid victories
which they had obtained by means of it, would, for a considerable
period of time, render it a useless task, to attempt to convince
them, of the superiority of the newly discovered military
engines.&nbsp; Until their efficacy had been often proved, their
shape and workmanship had attained some degree of perfection, and
the artificers employed in their production, had become
sufficiently skilful, to make different kinds and sizes, one
description of which was portable, and was eventually called Hand
Cannon, Hand Gun, or Hand Culverin, and, subsequently,
Harquebuss, Arquebuse, Haquebut, Hackbut and Hagbut, the origin
of the modern Musket, the advantages of the recently discovered
engines of war, would be very slow in disclosing themselves; and
would by no means be sufficiently obvious, to induce a warlike
nation, precipitately to admit them into general use.</p>
<p>The change in the art of war, by the application of gunpowder
to military purposes, was extremely slow and gradual.</p>
<p>If any person, ignorant of, or not reflecting upon, that
circumstance, should ask, at what period the ancient weapons were
laid aside, and firearms introduced in their stead; the answer is
readily and correctly given.&nbsp; There never was such a
period.&nbsp; More than two centuries elapsed, after the common
application of gunpowder to warlike purposes in Europe, before
the English and the other European nations, entirely relinquished
the use of bows and arrows, and in lieu of them, but by slow
degrees adopted the use of firearms.</p>
<p>Archery for the purposes of war, had not been altogether
abandoned in this country, even at the breaking out of the civil
war, in the reign of Charles I.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>It
has been correctly remarked by Mr. Grose, in his <i>Military
Antiquities</i>, <a name="citation215a"></a><a
href="#footnote215a" class="citation">[215a]</a> that there is
amongst old soldiers, a great dislike to innovations, because, by
adopting new weapons, and, consequently, a new exercise, the old
and expert soldiers find themselves in a worse state than new
recruits, as they have not only a new exercise to learn, but also
the old one to forget.</p>
<p>Indeed, as late as the year 1557, so evenly did the public
opinion run, between the comparative efficacy of the ancient and
new systems, that in that year, by an act of Parliament (of the
4th and 5th of Philip and Mary), <a name="citation215b"></a><a
href="#footnote215b" class="citation">[215b]</a> respecting the
providing of armour and weapons, various persons, in Wales,
Lancashire, and Cheshire, were required to provide and keep a
haquebut; or, in lieu of one, the alternative was given to each
of them, to keep a long bow and sheaf of arrows, in such
instances, where he was required by that act, to provide himself
with the former.</p>
<p>Some interesting and curious examples may be found of the use
of cannons of various kinds, by the English, in their wars with
the French, in the fourteenth century, in the reign of Edward
III.; <a name="citation215c"></a><a href="#footnote215c"
class="citation">[215c]</a> but although it is indisputable that
they were then made use of in sieges, and in the defence of
fortified places, there does not appear to be any evidence, that
they were made use of in that century, in the field, by the <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>English; <a
name="citation216a"></a><a href="#footnote216a"
class="citation">[216a]</a> and the defective construction of the
cannons of the time of Edward III., and the silence of the
English and French historians, raise very strong doubts, whether
they ever were so used at that period.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>It
is, however, the use of them in the fifteenth century, to which
our attention is at present to be devoted.&nbsp; Although writers
admit the occasional use of cannons and other firearms by the
English, in that century, it has been commonly imagined, that
they were not generally used by them until the following
one.&nbsp; I, therefore, shall endeavour to show, that that idea
is not correct, and that in the fifteenth century, firearms of
various descriptions and sizes, were in general use by them, as
principal and important military weapons; that they appear seldom
to have undertaken any warlike expedition of magnitude without
them; that they constantly attacked and defended towns and
fortresses with them; that they used them in the open field; and
also, that there is some evidence of guns being in use even on
shipboard.&nbsp; The English, as early as in the middle of that
century, were also sometimes armed with portable guns, or small
arms, then called Hand Coulevrines, or hand guns; and they are
expressly mentioned by Monstrelet by the name of
&ldquo;Coulevrines &agrave; main,&rdquo; and he states, that they
were reserved to the English, at Caen, in 1450, when they
capitulated under the Duke of Somerset.&nbsp; This was
considerably earlier than the period, when Mr. Grose, in his work
on <i>Military Antiquities</i>, <a name="citation217a"></a><a
href="#footnote217a" class="citation">[217a]</a> supposes that
they were first used in England; as he mentions the year 1471, on
the occasion of the landing of Edward IV. at Ravenspur, as the
period of their introduction into this country.</p>
<p>Monstrelet, as will be afterwards noticed, mentions
&ldquo;Petis Canons&rdquo; as having been carried in eight little
boats across the Seine, by the English, in attacking Pont de
l&rsquo;Arche, in 1418, which, and also the &ldquo;Artillerie
menue,&rdquo; occasionally mentioned by him, probably apply to
guns of a size small enough to be portable. <a
name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b"
class="citation">[217b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>We
cannot well entertain doubts of the fact of the English having
made use of portable firearms in the fifteenth century, when we
reflect that there is undisputed historical evidence of the use
of them, at that period, by continental nations, who reckoned
them by thousands in their armies; and that before the close of
that century, they appear to have been even used on the Continent
by cavalry as well as by infantry. <a name="citation218a"></a><a
href="#footnote218a" class="citation">[218a]</a></p>
<p>Very early in the fifteenth century, firearms varied very much
in size, appearance, and denomination; and even as early as in
the year 1406, the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France, in
preparing for the siege of Calais, had, according to Monstrelet,
&ldquo;bombardes, canons, artilleries,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; We also learn from the same authority, that in
1430, in raising the siege of Compeine, which was defended by the
English, the Duke of Burgundy was obliged to abandon his
ordnance, consisting of &ldquo;bombardes, canons, veuglaires,
serpentines, coulevrines, et autre artilleries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word Artillery, and also the word Engine, did not,
however, apply in the fifteenth century exclusively to cannons;
for <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>both
words were frequently used to designate all projectile weapons,
such as balist&aelig;, long-bows, cross-bows, guns of various
descriptions, bombards (somewhat resembling the modern mortars),
and also portable firearms.</p>
<p>Some descriptions of cannons, as, for example, those called
bombards, <a name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a> which are considered to have been the
first in use, threw large stones or balls, by a parabolic curve,
against places besieged, whilst others were afterwards
introduced, of a different description, which sent balls direct,
or point blank.</p>
<p>In 1414, one Nicholas Merbury was Master of the Ordnance to
Henry V., &ldquo;Magistro Operationum Ingeniorum &amp;
Gunnarum.&rdquo; <a name="citation219b"></a><a
href="#footnote219b" class="citation">[219b]</a>&nbsp; There was
also a Master of the Ordnance in 1481, in the reign of Edward
IV.; and a warrant was then issued for the payment of &pound;100
to the Master of the Ordnance, for the purchase of draught
horses. <a name="citation219c"></a><a href="#footnote219c"
class="citation">[219c]</a></p>
<p>I apprehend that it will not be denied, that it affords very
strong evidence of this destructive instrument of war, being
brought to considerable perfection, and into general use, when
the genus had thus become subdivided into species, and when a
public officer existed, whose province it was to superintend that
particular department of military affairs.</p>
<p>Later on, in the same century, it became still more
subdivided, and appears to have consisted of many varieties; for
we read of bombards, cannons, mortiers, veuglaires, guns,
serpentines, ordnance, fowlers, coulevrines, hand-coulevrines,
hand-guns, haquebuts, &amp;c. &amp;c.; from which it may be
presumed, that gunnery had then become a science, and occupied a
great portion of the attention of the military.</p>
<p>The bombard is supposed to have derived its name from the
sound proceeding from its explosion; the mortier or mortar, from
its death-dealing or destructive nature; the serpentine <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>basilisk
and coulevrine, from some fancied resemblance in their appearance
or effects to a serpent; the fowler, to the rapid and birdlike
flight of its ball; and some of the large bombards were jocularly
called &ldquo;bourgeoise,&rdquo; from their constant residence in
one place, their weight rendering them inconvenient to move. <a
name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a></p>
<p>Under whatever name or form, however, this destructive engine
appeared, its general effects were, to a certain extent, similar;
and I venture to think, that the authorities, which will now be
referred to in chronological order, furnish strong proofs of its
having become, not in occasional, but in general use for warlike
purposes by the English, in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;artillery,&rdquo; as has been already stated,
was formerly often used to denote cannons and other weapons, the
operation and efficacy of which entirely depended upon gunpowder,
and also projectile weapons of various descriptions, such as
long-bows, cross-bows of different kinds and sizes,
<i>balist&aelig; catapult&aelig;</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., which were
used in war quite independently of gunpowder.&nbsp; The same
observation also applies to the word &ldquo;engine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The English very frequently not only used engines which depended
upon gunpowder for their operation, but others which were
independent of it, in order to cast stones, &amp;c., in sieges,
in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; It is impossible, in every
instance which will be noticed in the following pages, to
determine clearly in which of those senses the word
&ldquo;artillery&rdquo; or &ldquo;engine&rdquo; is used; and it
must be left to the judgment of the reader to decide the meaning
from the context.</p>

<p>Although the cannons in the two last instances were not used
by, but were intended to be used against, the English, yet it has
been considered advisable to notice them, in order to show that
they were then commonly used in the wars in which the English
were engaged, and were intended in each instance to be used
against a town defended by the latter; and also to prove that at
that period there were firearms of various denominations.</p>

<p>In that warrant Nicholas Merbury is distinctly mentioned as <a

been Master of the Ordnance in the 2nd year of Henry V., but he
does not allude to the existence of any such officer in the reign
of Edward IV.</p>
<p>1414, 26th September.&mdash;Warrant of the 2nd Henry V. to the
Collectors of the customs and subsidies, and keepers of the
passages of the port of London, &amp;c., prohibiting the
exportation of gunpowder without a special permission,
&ldquo;aliquod Gunpoudre versus partes exteras, in portu
pr&aelig;dicto, absque speciali mandato nostro, transmitti
permittatis.&rdquo;&mdash;9 <i>F&aelig;dera</i>, fo. 160.</p>
<p>1415.&mdash;The army of Henry V., on landing in France, is
stated to have been composed of &ldquo;environ six mille bacinets
et 24 mille archiers sans les Canoniers et autres usans de
flondelles et engins, <a name="citation224"></a><a
href="#footnote224" class="citation">[224]</a> d&#333;t ils
avoi&#275;t gr&#257;d abondance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Monstrelet</i>,
vol. i. fo. 218.</p>
<p>It appears very difficult to ascertain the kind of instrument
meant by &ldquo;flondelles.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems far-fetched to
consider it as a corruption of the words &ldquo;frondes&rdquo;
(slings), besides which, there is not, as far as I am aware, any
authority for supposing that the English used slings in
battle.&nbsp; A word nearly similar (&ldquo;fondeffles&rdquo;)
also occurs in 1 <i>Monstrelet</i>, p. 27, and is used in
conjunction with &ldquo;eschelles,&rdquo; which is evidently
scaling ladders, which raises the presumption that it was some
engine used in sieges.</p>
<p>Same year.&mdash;At the siege of Harfleur the English
&ldquo;asseirent leurs gros engins <a name="citation224"></a><a

<p>1418, 10th February.&mdash;Warrant in 5th Henry V. to John
Louthe:&mdash;&ldquo;Clerico operationum Ordinationis
nostr&aelig;;&rdquo; and to John Benett, of Maidstone, mason, to
press workmen to make &ldquo;septem milium Lapidum pro Gunnes de
diversis sortibus.&rdquo;&mdash;9 <i>F&aelig;dera</i>, fo.
542.</p>
<p>John Louthe, clerk of the Ordnance, and this warrant, in which
he is named, are noticed by Grose, vol. i. p. 198.</p>
<p>Same year.&mdash;Warrant to the same John Louthe, to procure
workmen and materials:&mdash;&ldquo;Quot pro factura trescentorum
Pavys Grossorum pro Gunnis, Quaterviginti Blokk, et septem milium
Tampons pro eisdem, Quinquaginta jugorum de Ligno pro Bobus infra
trahendis, Centum Cathenarum pro eisdem, Duodecim Carectarum
Grossarum pro Gunnis Grossis supracariandis, viginti piparum de
Pulvere de Carbonibus silicis, necessaria
fuerint.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>F&aelig;dera</i>, fo. 543.</p>
<p>The use of the words &ldquo;Pavys grossorum pro Gunnis,&rdquo;
goes a long way to prove that gunners, like archers, were covered
or protected in action, at that period, by the shield-like
instruments called the Pavaise, Pavys, or Pavache.</p>
<p>Same year.&mdash;In the passage of the Seine, in his advance
upon Pont de l&rsquo;Arche, the English
commander:&mdash;&ldquo;vint pour passer Seine &agrave; tout

<p>In the above quotation, the word &ldquo;engine&rdquo; seems to
apply to such instruments of war as cannons, culverins,

before, that the word was used both in describing those
projectile weapons <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

were used without it.</p>

<p>Same year.&mdash;On the surrender of Caen, by the Duke of
Somerset, to the French, he stipulated for the departure of the

up the prisoners, acquitting the burgesses, and others in the
town, of all demands, and not taking away any thing of
theirs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Et avec ce qu&rsquo;ils lasseroient toute

<p>We have therefore here the hand-coulevrine (hand-culverin or
hand-gun) distinctly mentioned as in use amongst the
English.&nbsp; <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

not to have been aware of the above, and, in his <i>Military
Antiquities</i>, vol. i. page 153, and vol. ii. page 29, he
mentions the year 1471, upon the landing of Edward IV. at
Ravenspur, in Yorkshire, as the period of the first introduction
of hand-guns into this country.</p>
<p>1450.&mdash;Amongst the charges against William Duke of

<p>From the above passage it seems not unreasonable to infer that
cannons were at that date used on shipboard by the English.</p>
<p>Same year.&mdash;Osbert Mountforth was sent towards Guisnes,
to assist the Duke of Somerset, and was attacked and captured

<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>The
exact date uncertain, but in the reign of Henry VI.&mdash;An
account is given in Fenn&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Original

Henry VI., between some English ships and some ships of Holland,
Zealand, Flanders, &amp;c., in which Robert Wenyngton appears to
have commanded the English vessels; and he states that the
enemy&rsquo;s ships &ldquo;schotte atte us a 1000 gonnys and
quarrell owte of nu&rsquo;ber, and have slayn meny of my
felyschyp and meymyd all soo.&rdquo;&mdash;The meaning seems to
be, that there were 1000 discharges from the enemy&rsquo;s
guns.&nbsp; The engagement is noticed here, although the guns
were used on board the enemy&rsquo;s vessels, because there can
scarcely be a doubt, that if they were used on board those
vessels, at that period, they must also have been in use on board
English vessels.&mdash;Fenn&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Original

721.</p>
<p>It can scarcely admit of any doubt that hand-guns must have
been the weapons there meant, and that they were so called from
being sufficiently light to be portable by the hand.&nbsp; The
word &ldquo;hange&rdquo; seems to be merely a corruption of the
word &ldquo;hand,&rdquo; <a name="citation238"></a><a
href="#footnote238" class="citation">[238]</a> which is confirmed
by the following authority:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had with him <span class="GutSmall">IXC</span> of

citie with his power, having five hundred smokie gunners marching
foremost, being strangers, of such as he had brought over with
him.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <i>Holinshed</i>, fo. 683.</p>
<p>It seems tolerably clear that the 500 men there described as
smoke gunners, were armed with portable firearms, and probably
carried lighted matches; and, although the numbers do not tally,
we cannot well doubt that they were the same men already
mentioned as armed with &ldquo;hange-guns,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;hande-gonnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Besides which, we also learn from Holinshed, that the
Lancastrians, during the night before the battle, continually
discharged their cannons at the camp of Edward IV.; and Holinshed
adds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King would not suffer anie of his gunnes in all
that night to be shot off, least thereby they might have gessed
the ground, and so levelled their artillerie to his
annoyance.&rdquo;&mdash;Holinshed&rsquo;s <i>Chronicles</i>, vol.

class="citation">[245d]</a> he was first cousin of Richard Wyche,
the first of the family who settled at Alderley.</p>
<p>The armorial bearings of the members of the family were, <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&ldquo;Azure, a pile ermine; crest, an arm embowed
azure, cuffed ermine, holding a trefoil vert.&rdquo; <a
name="citation246a"></a><a href="#footnote246a"
class="citation">[246a]</a>&nbsp; In the second volume of
Edmonson&rsquo;s <i>Heraldry</i>, the crest is rather differently
stated, viz., crest, &ldquo;a dexter arm embowed, habited gules,
turned up or; holding in the hand proper a sprig vert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Lysons&rsquo; <i>Magna Britannia</i> the family is named <a
name="citation246b"></a><a href="#footnote246b"
class="citation">[246b]</a> amongst the Cheshire families still
resident in the county, whose descent has been continued in an
uninterrupted male line for more than three centuries, and some
of them for a much greater length of time. <a
name="citation246c"></a><a href="#footnote246c"
class="citation">[246c]</a></p>
<p>In Ormerod&rsquo;s <i>Cheshire</i> <a
name="citation246d"></a><a href="#footnote246d"
class="citation">[246d]</a> it is stated that some of the
descendants of the family of Wyche were still remaining in the
neighbourhood of Soss Moss Hall; that work was published in 1819:
and in Lysons&rsquo; <i>Mag. Britannia</i>, <a
name="citation246e"></a><a href="#footnote246e"
class="citation">[246e]</a> which was published in 1810, it is
stated that the immediate descendant of this ancient family, then
(in 1810), rented a farm in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>It
lies in my power to corroborate those statements.&nbsp; William
Wyche, a tenant of my father, Richard Brooke, Esq., of Liverpool,
resided, when those works were written, and during many years
previously, on a farm which belongs to my father, <a
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247"
class="citation">[247]</a> rather more than a mile from Soss Moss
Hall; the farm, which is called the Peck Mill Farm, is in Little
Warford, in the parish of Rostherne, and there is not any reason
to doubt that William Wyche, the tenant, was, as he claimed to
be, a lineal descendant of this ancient family.&nbsp; He was an
old man, of limited education even for a small farmer, so much so
that if he could read, he could not write perfectly.&nbsp; He
died about 1821, and the farm was then occupied by his widow,
Elizabeth Wyche, for several years, and afterwards by his son,
Samuel Wyche, who was in very poor circumstances, and left it in
1839.</p>
<p>On the 28th of April, 1822, and again on 26th of December,
1831, I went to look at Soss Moss Hall; and on the 4th of
September, 1848, I happened to be at the Peck Mill Farm, and
feeling a desire once more to examine the seat of this ancient
family, I walked from the farm to Soss Moss, to amuse myself with
another inspection of the old hall, and I found little or no
change in it since my first visit.&nbsp; It stands about three
hundred yards to the southward of the public road at Soss Moss,
in Nether Alderley, and about half that distance from the London
and North-Western (formerly the Manchester and Birmingham)
Railway, which lies between the road and the mansion.&nbsp; It is
two stories high, besides having one or two rooms in the roof,
and is of very antique appearance, principally built of timber
and plaster, the timber being disposed in squares, in the style
sometimes called &ldquo;pillar and panel.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
east end is the following inscription, cut in antique letters, in
stone, on a projecting stack of chimneys, or range of chimney
flues, of great size:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class='gutoutline'><b>T.
WYCHE</b></span><br />
<span class='gutoutline'><b>1583</b></span></p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>which, no doubt, gives the correct date of the building
or rebuilding of the eastern wing.&nbsp; In a room in the western
wing, used as a dairy or milk-room, is a stone slab (similar to
those used in dairies for placing vessels of milk upon), with the
letters cut on it, in similar characters, <span
class='gutoutline'>E W</span>.&nbsp; <span class='gutoutline'>W
W</span>.&nbsp; Of course they relate to other members of the
family of Wyche.</p>
<p>On entering the edifice, we come into a room on the ground
floor, now used as what is there termed a house-place (partaking
in some degree both of the nature of a sitting-room and a
kitchen), lighted by a large window, with small panes of glass
let into lead, in the cottage style; over it is a border of
carved small round ornaments, resembling the roundles of
heraldry.&nbsp; This room has evidently been once the large hall,
or part of the large hall, or principal room of the mansion; it
has much the appearance of having had a portion of the east end
cut off to form other rooms, on the ground floor, which are now
used for various purposes; at present it looks small and
insignificant for such a mansion.</p>
<p>The ceiling of this room is formed of oak planks, quite black,
with strong heavy beams of oak of the same colour.&nbsp; It has
had a very large projecting chimney, with chimney-corners and a
fire-place; but, although the form and appearance remain, it is
in part built up, and a common modern grate and fire-place are
substituted.</p>
<p>The principal staircase is of oak planks, and its balustrade
is of the same wood, with large flat balusters, and a heavy
carved hand-rail, all black with age.&nbsp; On the first floor,
up the stairs, on the landing, in one of the bed-chambers, and in
a cheese-room, the old oak floors remain nearly entire; and the
oak floor also partially remains in another room at the eastern
end of the building, on the same story; into this room a
communication was not long since made from the bed-chamber before
mentioned, and in making it the workmen discovered that they were
merely reopening an old door-case (which had been long blocked
up), with its jambs and lintel.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>The
room into which the communication was so opened had formerly been
let off as part of a distinct dwelling; it lies at the eastern
extremity of the mansion, and is now used as a bedchamber.&nbsp;
It is remarkable for being the place of discovery of an ancient
painting, which it is to be regretted was never seen by any
person capable of copying or properly describing it.&nbsp; The
old hall is now tenanted by a farmer, who informed me that, in
1847, when he was making a fire-place in it, at the east end, and
close to the range of chimney-flues before mentioned, with which
the fire-place now communicates, he caused some plaster to be
removed, and by that removal exposed to view a painting on stone,
representing several men and females, about five or six inches in
height.&nbsp; The only description which he could give me of them
was, that they appeared to him to have very droll dresses, like
long flowing robes, of different colours, with ornaments, which
he supposed to represent large buttons; that some of the figures
had curiously shaped hats (his description of them conveyed to me
the idea of their being something in the style of Spanish hats),
and he stated that the painting did not appear to him to
represent any Scripture subject.&nbsp; It was covered over again
with building materials when the fire-place was completed.&nbsp;
It is much to be regretted that the figures were not copied, or
at least examined by some person conversant with such subjects;
as it is more than probable that they would have afforded a
curious and authentic illustration of the dresses of persons of
the higher classes, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, about
1583.&nbsp; Some slight indications of a similar painting were
once visible, over the fire-place, in a room on the ground floor
under the room which will be next described.</p>
<p>There is also, on the first floor, and at the east end of the
mansion, another chamber, which once had a door of communication
with the room in which the painting was discovered, but of which
the door-way, though visible, is now built up, and which is at
present entered from the outside of the building, by <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>a modern
staircase and door.&nbsp; In this chamber there is a closet,
built of stone, and ingeniously built into and forming part of
the stack or range of chimney-flues before mentioned.&nbsp; The
chamber has a fire-place, on the left of which is the stone
closet before mentioned, which was once entered by a thin oaken
door, of which the lower half still remains, the upper portion
having been sawn off.&nbsp; The closet has been lighted from the
outside, by two small apertures in the stone work at the back of
it, now built up. <a name="citation250a"></a><a
href="#footnote250a" class="citation">[250a]</a></p>
<p>I could not discover that there were any traces of the old
hall having ever been surrounded by a moat, as is the case with
some other halls near that part of Cheshire. <a
name="citation250b"></a><a href="#footnote250b"
class="citation">[250b]</a></p>
<p>Upon the whole, considering that it belonged to a family of
eminence in the county, I was disappointed with the size of Soss
Moss Hall, the appearance of the rooms, and the want of the
conveniences and comforts which, even three centuries ago, such a
family might be reasonably supposed to require; nor does the hall
convey to a spectator the idea of a mansion formerly inhabited by
a leading family in the county.&nbsp; Besides which, the
situation of the hall is bad: it is quite in a flat, the soil is
poor and sandy; the public road near it was bad in several
places, within my recollection; and, from the appearance of
bog-earth in many situations close to it, there cannot be a doubt
that, less than three centuries ago, the land about it must have
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>been
wet, and almost a swamp; and certainly it was not the situation
which we should expect a family of a certain rank in the county,
to select for their principal mansion.</p>
<p>The last time that I heard anything of the son of old William
Wyche was in September, 1848, when I learnt that he had been for
some time an ostler at a small inn at Knutsford, and had since
been a labouring gardener at Manchester, or in its vicinity, and
was then in very indifferent circumstances, and out of
work.&nbsp; Such has been the falling away, and sad reverse, in
the fortunes of the old and once high and influential Cheshire
family of Wyche, or De la Wyche!</p>

253</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
WILMSLOW CHURCH,<br />
CHESHIRE. <a name="citation253a"></a><a href="#footnote253a"
class="citation">[253a]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Wilmslow is in the
hundred of Macclesfield, in Cheshire, and before the introduction
of railways, the mail-coach road from Manchester to Birmingham
passed through it.&nbsp; It has not the advantage of having a
market, but has some little trade, and possesses the convenience
of being one of the stations of the London and North-Western
(formerly the Manchester and Birmingham) Railway, which passes
close to it; and it is pleasantly situate on the south bank of
the river Bollin, which there flows through a picturesque and
beautiful valley.</p>
<p>The parish of Wilmslow (anciently called Le Bolyn) contains
four townships:&mdash;Bollin Fee, which comprehends the hamlets
of Bollin-cum-Norcliffe, Hough, and Dean Row; Pownall Fee, which
comprehends the hamlets of Morley and Styal; Chorley, also
comprehended in the manor of Pownall Fee; and Fulshaw.</p>
<p>Wilmslow, in strictness, singularly enough, consists
exclusively of the parish church with its churchyard, and of a
small plot of land, now covered with buildings, near the church;
and <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>nearly the whole of the town is built in the hamlets of
Hough and Dean Row.</p>
<p>The church is dedicated to St. Bartholomew, and is built of
dark-coloured stone, close to the river, and consequently derives
no advantage from elevation or position.&nbsp; The tower is
ornamented with battlements and pinnacles, and has a peal of six
bells; and both the tower and the church are of the Gothic style
of architecture, though with some modern alterations.&nbsp; The
church has evidently been rebuilt and considerably altered, at
various periods, one of the latest of which must have been not
long prior to the Reformation; and it has a clerestory and
rood-loft.&nbsp; The nave of the church is spacious, and on each
side of it, and of the chancel, are lofty and pointed arches,
supported by octagonal pillars.</p>
<p>The pulpit has some handsome carved work, of a style which was
common in the time of Elizabeth and James I.&nbsp; On each side
of the chancel is an oratory or chapel.&nbsp; These chapels are
separated from the altar, by projecting wing-walls, and also from
the body of the chancel, by portions of an oaken screen, much
mutilated; but the portions which remain are sufficient to show
that it has been handsome; and on the south side, some small
Tudor roses are yet visible in many parts; and a continuation of
the wood-work, much defaced, extends under the rood-loft, so as
to separate the chancel from the nave.</p>
<p>The chapel on the south side of the chancel is called the Earl
of Stamford&rsquo;s Chapel, or the Booth Chapel.&nbsp; The
present Earl of Stamford is a descendant of the family of that
name.&nbsp; It contains a massive raised tomb, evidently of very
great antiquity, built against the wall on the south side, and
bearing a strong resemblance to an altar; the inscription, if it
ever contained any, is now quite obliterated.&nbsp; A grave-stone
near it commemorates the &ldquo;fifth son of S. William Booth, of
Dunham Massey, who departed this life the 28th day of March,
1620,&rdquo; at least so the date appeared to me; but there is
some difficulty in deciding upon the two last figures of it,
because the wood-work of a <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>partition nearly covers them.&nbsp;
Adjoining to it is another grave-stone, much defaced, to the
memory of Lady Elizabeth Booth, who died on the 14th June,
1636.&nbsp; It appears, from a statement of donations painted up
in another part of the church, that this lady benevolently left a
sum of money, for the distribution of twelve loaves of bread
weekly, to poor aged persons in Wilmslow; a dole which is still
kept up.</p>
<p>In this chapel, close to the left side of the door, on
entering from the churchyard, is an ancient pew, with carved
panels at the back, on one of which are cut the following
initials and date:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class='gutoutline'>S G B
B</span><br />
<span class='gutoutline'>1557</span>.</p>
<p>Probably meant for Sir George Booth, of Bollin, because at one
period, the Booths resided at Bollin Hall, near Wilmslow, which
was, after many mutations and alterations, reduced to the rank of
a farmhouse, and was at last pulled down, when the railway was
made.</p>
<p>The chapel or oratory, on the north side of the chancel and
altar, is called the Pownall Chapel, and in its east window are
four scrolls, in stained glass, each containing the words,
&ldquo;Ego autem in D&ntilde;o gaudebo.&rdquo; <a
name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b"
class="citation">[255b]</a>&nbsp; On the north side of the
chapel, is a piscina <a name="citation255a"></a><a
href="#footnote255a" class="citation">[255a]</a> in the wall; and
on the south side, on the floor, close to the projecting
wing-wall, separating it from the altar, is a grave-stone,
evidently of great antiquity, with a singularly shaped cross
carved upon it, the ends of the arms of which are sloped off,
instead of being carved square; and the inscription is almost
illegible, except that on each side of the cross, there are yet
to be seen the initials <span class='gutoutline'>T H S</span>, in
the old characters.</p>
<p>At the east end of the chancel, is a large and handsome altar
window, of the Perpendicular Gothic style; and on the outside,
immediately above it, is a carved shield of arms, containing
&ldquo;the <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>Griffin segreant,&rdquo; the armorial bearing of the
Traffords.&nbsp; In the projecting wall, on the north side of the
altar, is a small square open recess, apparently intended, in
former ages, for an almbury, or aumbery, in which the sacred
vessels, and articles used in the celebration of the mass, were
usually kept.&nbsp; The roof of the church is very handsome, of
oak, the cross beams being elaborately carved, and in various
places in the roof, the initial letters <span
class='gutoutline'>H. T.</span> appear in the ancient character,
doubtless intended for Henry Trafford, the last rector of
Wilmslow, before the overthrow of the Papal supremacy, and the
first of that rectory of the Reformed religion, if the
Reformation can strictly be said to have been established, during
the lifetime of the capricious monarch, Henry VIII.&nbsp; I shall
have occasion to say more of this ecclesiastic hereafter.&nbsp;
There are also one or two shields of arms painted on the beams,
containing &ldquo;the Griffin segreant, gules;&rdquo; they
furnish additional proof, that a large portion of the church, and
probably the roof, were rebuilt or renovated, just before the
Reformation.&nbsp; Amongst other ornaments on the roof, an
etoile, or star, appears painted in several places where the
beams intersect each other. <a name="citation256"></a><a
href="#footnote256" class="citation">[256]</a></p>
<p>The font is massive, quite devoid of ornament, and bears the
appearance of great antiquity.</p>
<p>At the west end of the church is an arch, which is said to
have formerly opened into the belfry of the tower; it is an exact
segment of a circle; but as it has not the slightest appearance
of the zig-zag, or dog&rsquo;s-tooth, or any other of the
ornaments so generally met with, on Norman arches, I am of
opinion that it is of a comparatively modern date, and was
probably erected when a portion of the church and its tower were
rebuilt or altered, not long before the Reformation.&nbsp; This
idea receives some degree of countenance from the circumstance,
<a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>that on
the south-west corner of the outside of the tower, is a niche
with its carved canopy, which formerly contained an image, said
to have been that of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The church porch, which fronts the south, has been handsome,
and much ornamented, but is now considerably defaced, and over
the porch entrance is a handsomely carved niche with its canopy,
<a name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a> which is said to have contained an
image of Saint Bartholomew, the tutelary saint of the church; but
at present, in lieu of the old saint, the niche is disfigured by
an unsightly slab, or piece of stone, of a different colour to
the rest of the stonework near it, let into the niche with an
inscription, communicating the important fact, that certain good
men were churchwardens some thirty or forty years ago. <a
name="citation257b"></a><a href="#footnote257b"
class="citation">[257b]</a>&nbsp; The fact of the existence on
the walls of an old church, of niches, which contain, or formerly
contained, images, is a sufficient proof, that they must have
been erected, at least before the Reformation.</p>
<p>On the south side of the nave of the church is a chapel,
projecting into the churchyard, called the Hawthorn Chapel,
which, in the last century but one, belonged to a junior branch
of the Leighs, of Hawthorn Hall, near Wilmslow.&nbsp; The arms of
Leigh, &ldquo;argent, a lion rampant, gardant, gules,&rdquo; with
a crescent for difference, and also the crest of the family,
appear painted over an arch, which connects it with the church,
and also in stained glass in the window of the chapel.</p>
<p>This chapel appears, from the style of its window, to have
been rebuilt or altered, since the general prevalence of the
Gothic style, but as some remains of inscriptions, in ancient
characters, have been discovered on its walls, the inference is,
that it is an old chapel rebuilt or much altered.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Hawthorn Hall, and the estate belonging to it,
afterwards came from the Leighs to the family of Page, who were
the proprietors of it, and resided there, during a considerable
part of the eighteenth century, and at last sold it to a person
named Bower, and it is now used as a school.&nbsp; It is about
half a mile from Wilmslow, and is an antique brick mansion, with
large gables, and a small cupola, and much resembles the style of
mansions which were in fashion during the reign of William III.,
said to have been adopted from the Dutch.&nbsp; The same armorial
bearings, before mentioned, of the Leighs, with the crescent for
difference, appears over the principal entrances, on the north
and south fronts of the mansion; and on the lead spouts are the
initials of one of the Leighs, J L, and the date, 1698; which
probably may also give us a hint of the date of the rebuilding of
the chapel.</p>
<p>In my observations on Wilmslow Church, I ought not to omit
mentioning, that in the churchyard, at the east end, is an
ancient grave-stone, with the date 1596, and on the north side of
the church is another, of the same date, inscribed with the
names, &ldquo;Phe. Dale.&rdquo; <a name="citation258"></a><a
href="#footnote258" class="citation">[258]</a></p>
<p>Under the altar is an under-ground chapel or sacristy, which
at one time was unworthily used as a charnel-house, and when I
visited it, in January, 1849, it was a place of deposit for
bricks and rubbish; I am glad to hear that they have since been
removed.&nbsp; With some difficulty I entered it from the
churchyard, by an opening which exists under the large altar
window.&nbsp; It is not vaulted with stone, as might have been
expected, but the wooden floor near the altar forms its
roof.&nbsp; Three recesses, <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>resembling sedilia, in the Gothic
style, and which, if they had been discovered near an altar,
would be at once pronounced to be sedilia, are formed in the wall
in front of the opening, and the centre one has an inclined
groove on each side, cut into the stone, which rather conveys the
impression as if a temporary desk, for reading, had formerly been
sometimes fixed up there.&nbsp; It is lighted by loopholes,
opening into the churchyard; and on the south side is a narrow
winding staircase, of which many of the steps remain, which at
one time gave access from the altar to it, but the communication
is now built up.&nbsp; The steps in it commence under a plain
Gothic arch, and the staircase was lighted by a loophole, which
still remains.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Matthias Turner, D.D., afterwards Bishop of
Calcutta, succeeded to the rectory about 1823, an interval having
elapsed subsequent to the death of Mr. Bradshaw, about 1820,

<p>Whilst describing Wilmslow Church, although I avow myself a
Protestant, and a member of the Church of England, without any
kind of leaning towards the Church of Rome, and without even
admiration of her rites or ceremonies, I feel myself called upon,
as an act of common justice to our Roman Catholic predecessors,
to mention, that I have remarked, both in Wilmslow Church, and in
various other ancient churches erected before the Reformation,
that they appear better calculated for hearing, or, in other
words, for the transmission of sound, than more modern churches;
yet we might suppose that the large arches and massive pillars in
the former would militate against that effect.&nbsp; It may be
that the architects of an age gone by, understood the science of
acoustics better than those of our time, and I throw out the
suggestion (without giving any confident opinion), whether the
pillars, arches, and carved oak roof, may not have the effect of
preventing the too great number of pulses, or repetitions of
sound in a given time, by returns from the walls, on the
principle, that although the human voice in a large room, quite
devoid of furniture, carpets, curtains, or a <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>crowded
assembly, will often produce a confused and indistinct echo, yet
the resonance of the room becomes diminished, and the
reverberation of sound becomes less, and consequently we can
sometimes hear better, when the speaker is delivering his address
in the room, when it is properly furnished, and contains a number
of auditors.&nbsp; I may also add, that there is not any place of
worship which I have been accustomed to attend, where I am more
impressed (if so much) with feelings of devotion, than when
attending divine service in this and other ancient churches
erected before the Reformation; whether those feelings may arise
from the reflection forcing itself upon the mind, that
generations after generations of our fellow-creatures have
worshipped there, and died since the walls of the sacred edifice
were erected, or whether the massive walls, pillars, arches, and
Gothic windows, naturally produce a certain degree of solemnity
or seriousness on the mind, I cannot say; I can only speak to the
effect which I have mentioned, be the cause what it may.</p>
<p>There is a very ancient chest in the vestry, in which are
contained the parish books, which is said to be 500 years
old.&nbsp; It is formed out of one solid block of oak, nearly
four feet wide, by five feet long, and three feet deep.</p>
<p>On the north side of the altar, and erected as a continuation
of the wing-wall before mentioned, is a very remarkable and
perfect monument.&nbsp; On an altar-tomb, <a
name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261"
class="citation">[261]</a> and in flowing ecclesiastical robes,
lies, the size of life, the effigy of Henry Trafford, who was
rector of Wilmslow, both whilst the Roman Catholic religion was
predominant here, and after the overthrow of the Papal
supremacy.&nbsp; He obtained the living at least as early as
1522, and died in 1537; and the figure is interesting, as
combining, so to speak, badges of both the old and the reformed
religion.&nbsp; The head has the tonsure or shaven crown, but it
rests upon a large clasped book, evidently intended for a Bible:
a combination which I do not recollect having ever seen in any <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>other
monument.&nbsp; On the leaves of the Bible, parts of a short
inscription are visible; but I was not able to read more than the
words &ldquo;ut non,&rdquo; which are not very legible.&nbsp;
Round the four upper edges of the tomb is the following
inscription, which unfortunately is not cut, but painted on the
stone, and although now legible, it is by no means certain that
it will long continue so:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet corp&rsquo; Mr. Henr&rsquo;ci
Treffort sacre theologie doctor lice&rsquo;ciat
quo&rsquo;d&rsquo; ca&rsquo;celarii metropolit&rsquo;
eccl&rsquo;ie Ebor&rsquo; et Rector de Holt&#333; ps&#333;n

class="GutSmall">MCCCCCXXXVII</span> cuj&rsquo; ai&rsquo;e
o&rsquo;ipote&rsquo;s De&rsquo; sit
p&rsquo;pti&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English the inscription reads thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lies the body of Mr. Henry Trafford, a Doctor
in Divinity, formerly Surrogate of the Chancellor of the
Metropolitan Church of York, and Rector of Halton, Parson and
Rector of the Church of Sigglisthorne, and of this Church, who
died on the first day of the month of August, in the year of our
Lord one thousand five hundred and thirty-seven: to whose soul be
the Almighty God merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Lysons&rsquo; <i>Mag. Brit.</i> <a
name="citation262a"></a><a href="#footnote262a"
class="citation">[262a]</a> it is stated, that on the side of
this tomb are painted an emaciated body, and scrolls with
inscriptions, in text-hand.&nbsp; I however could not discover
any trace of them, and probably they have been for some time
defaced.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry V. the advowson of Wilmslow came to the
family of Trafford, and now belongs to Sir T. J. De Trafford, <a
name="citation262b"></a><a href="#footnote262b"
class="citation">[262b]</a> Bart.</p>
<p>In the north wall of the Pownall Chapel are two obtuse arches,
with crockets and foliage; one containing a tomb, on which rests
the figure of a man, in flowing robes, his head resting between
two tuns or casks, with a scroll on his body, containing the word
&ldquo;Neuton.&rdquo;&nbsp; The adjoining one contains a tomb, on
which rests the figure of a female, in a flowing robe, with the
head resting on a garb, or sheaf of corn, and with <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>a purse or
pouch attached to her girdle.&nbsp; Both tombs have fronts,
ornamented with remains of carved work and shields, but they are
so much in the dark, by the construction of the seats, and the
valances in the pews, that even with a candle which the sexton
brought me, I could not discover any armorial bearings.&nbsp; The
pew adjoining the tomb which has the figure of the man, was not
long ago used by the residents of Pownall Hall, near Wilmslow,
which formerly belonged to an ancient family named Fitton,
afterwards to another named Pownall, and, after passing through
many hands, was purchased by Mr. John Worrall, in 1817, and was
again sold, some eighteen or nineteen years ago, to James
Pownall, Esq., <a name="citation263a"></a><a href="#footnote263a"
class="citation">[263a]</a> of Liverpool, who resided there for
some time after his purchase.</p>
<p>It is well known what a proneness existed, during the middle
ages, to make punning rebuses, even in sacred buildings; and if
the male figure be intended for the effigy of Humphrey Newton,
after mentioned, I cannot discover a reason for the head of that
figure being placed or fitted between two tuns or casks, which
appears intended as a rebus or figurative enigma on the word
Fit-ton, and has no allusion, that I am aware of, to the word
Newton.&nbsp; I do not mean to hazard any opinion as to the time
when the word &ldquo;Neuton&rdquo; was inscribed on it; but, if
it were originally inscribed there, I cannot see the application
of the punning rebus to the name Newton.&nbsp; I could not find
the slightest trace of any inscription except that, on either of
the monuments; but we are informed, on the authority of Ormerod,
<a name="citation263b"></a><a href="#footnote263b"
class="citation">[263b]</a> that on the man&rsquo;s tomb was
formerly the following inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Orate pro
Humphrido Neuton de Pownall Armigero, et Elena uxore ejus, fil:
et hered: Tho. Fitton et Cecilie ux: ejus, qui obiit <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> <span
class="GutSmall">MCCCCC</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A modern
inscription, in stained glass, also commemorating Humphrey Newton
and Ellen his wife, has been recently placed in the window above
the tomb.</p>
<p>In the chancel, in the front of the altar, is a grave-stone,
with <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>brasses, representing a male and female, Sir Robert
Booth, Knight, of Bollin and Dunham, and Douce, his wife, with
the right hand of the former clasping that of the latter.&nbsp;
This Sir Robert Booth is said <a name="citation264a"></a><a
href="#footnote264a" class="citation">[264a]</a> to have been
slain at the battle of Blore Heath, in the wars of York and
Lancaster; and there is every reason to believe the statement,
which is corroborated in a remarkable manner, by the fact that
the battle was fought on St. Tecla&rsquo;s day, <a
name="citation264b"></a><a href="#footnote264b"
class="citation">[264b]</a> 1459, which saint&rsquo;s day is
mentioned in the inscription on the brass, as the date of his
death.&nbsp; The following is a copy of the inscription, given by
Ormerod:<a name="citation264c"></a><a href="#footnote264c"
class="citation">[264c]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Hic jacent corpus
Roberti del Bothe, militis, quondam d&rsquo;ni de Bolyn,
Thorneton, et Dunh&rsquo;m qui obiit in festo <i>s&rsquo;ce Tecle
Virginis anno domini mill&rsquo;mo cccc</i><span
class="GutSmall">LX</span> <a name="citation264d"></a><a
href="#footnote264d" class="citation">[264d]</a> et corpus
<i>Dulcie ux&rsquo;ris d&rsquo;ci</i> Rob&rsquo;ti del Bothe que
obiit in castrino s&rsquo;cte be&rsquo;e Virginis anno Domini
mill&rsquo;mo <span class="GutSmall">CCCC</span> <i>quinquagesimo
tercio</i>, <i>quorum animabus p&rsquo;p&rsquo;tietur
Deus</i>.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some parts of the inscription have been purloined or lost, and
some portions are preserved in the vestry, and a small part still
remains affixed to the stone; but if the inscription given by
Ormerod be correct, as there is reason to believe, one or two
fragments, which probably got loose, have been injudiciously
riveted on, in wrong places.&nbsp; Immediately following the part
of the date relating to the husband, &ldquo;mill&rsquo;mo <span
class="GutSmall">CCCC</span>,&rdquo; the pieces of brass
containing the words &ldquo;quinquagesimo tercio, quorum animabus
p&rsquo;p&rsquo;tietur Deus. Amen,&rdquo; have been riveted on in
a wrong <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>place, and, so far from having any relation to the
death of the husband, clearly allude to the death of the wife, in
1453, and conclude with the prayer so common, in those times, for
the souls of both of them.</p>
<p>Such portions of the inscription as I could ascertain, from a
careful inspection both of the parts of the inscription and brass
fixed to the stone, and of the parts which are loose, are marked
in <i>italics</i> in the above copy of the inscription. <a
name="citation265a"></a><a href="#footnote265a"
class="citation">[265a]</a></p>
<p>The brass has originally had a handsome Gothic canopy engraved
over each figure, but at present one portion, that over the
husband, is missing.&nbsp; He is represented without a helmet,
and bareheaded, and in the armour of that age, but without
gauntlets (which indeed would have been a little incongruous, as
he is clasping the hand of his wife), and with a plated gorget,
and rather remarkable pauldrons; his feet rest upon a greyhound,
and near them is a shield of four quarters, of which the dexter
chief only can be deciphered, which represents a lion passant
gardant.&nbsp; The wife is represented in a loose robe, with her
hair flowing, and without any kind of head-dress, except a narrow
fillet or band, on which precious stones appear to have been
represented, and at her feet is a small dog; over her head is a
shield, on which is a bend with three garbs.&nbsp; A similar coat
of arms appears on the wood-work attached to a seat, situate very
near the grave, carved boldly, and evidently at a remote period
back, and it is also seen in stained glass in the large altar
window; it appears to be the arms of Fitton, which were,
&ldquo;argent, on a bend azure, three garbs, or.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some few other armorial bearings and fragments of stained glass,
but in very indifferent preservation, may be seen in the window
of the chancel. <a name="citation265b"></a><a
href="#footnote265b" class="citation">[265b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>In
concluding, I must here express my regret that this interesting
monument should be so situated as to be exposed to great risk of
injury, and even of destruction.&nbsp; It is usually covered by a
mat, but that is not a certain safeguard against its being worn
and trampled under foot, by persons passing through the chancel,
and it is close to the place where the charity children sit, a
class of beings not very likely to respect old monuments.&nbsp;
The same plan might be advantageously pursued respecting it,
which has been successfully adopted with other monuments, in
other churches: it might, at a very trivial expense, be removed,
with the grave-stone to which it is attached, and placed, in an
upright position, on one of the walls of the chancel, and a
common grave-stone might be put down in the place of the present
one, with a few words engraved, commemorating the removal.&nbsp;
The inscription on the Trafford tomb might, at a light expense,
be cut in, by a skilful man, so as to be a copy, <i>verbatim et
literatim</i>, of the words now painted on it, and precisely in
their present characters and places, in order to prevent the
inscription from being lost.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that some of the members of the families of
the personages interred under the two last-named monuments, will
adopt some plan, with the sanction of the rector, for their
preservation; if not, it would be judicious for some few
individuals, who possess sufficient taste to appreciate those
interesting memorials of an age long past, to set on foot a small
subscription, and adopt measures to preserve them from further
injury or mutilation.</p>
<p>The following lines, from Crabbe, <a name="citation266"></a><a
href="#footnote266" class="citation">[266]</a> may, without
impropriety, be quoted here, after describing the ancient
monuments in the church:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wonder not, mortal, at thy quick decay.<br
/>
See! men of marble piecemeal melt away;<br />
When whose the image we no longer read,<br />
But monuments themselves memorials need.&rdquo;</p>

HANDFORD HALL<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
CHEADLE CHURCH,<br />
CHESHIRE. <a name="citation267a"></a><a href="#footnote267a"
class="citation">[267a]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Handford</span> is a township of the
parish of Cheadle, in Cheshire, in the hundred of Macclesfield,
intersected by the London and North Western (formerly the
Manchester and Birmingham) Railway, and situated eleven miles
from Manchester, and five miles south-west-by-south from
Stockport.</p>
<p>The village of Handford is agreeably situated in a pleasant
part of Cheshire, upon the turnpike-road leading from Manchester
to Wilmslow and Congleton.&nbsp; On entering the village from the
northward, a neat but small country church, of brick, which is a
chapel-of-ease under Cheadle, lying on the left side of the road,
and a well-built National School, on the right, are conspicuous
objects.</p>
<p>The Village Green is noticed by Sir William Brereton, Bart.,
of Handford, whose family I shall soon have occasion to advert
to, and whose travels in Holland, England, &amp;c. &amp;c., in
1634 and 1635, have been published by the Cheetham Society, in <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>vol. i. of
the <i>Cheetham Papers</i>.&nbsp; He refers to the Village Green,
<a name="citation268a"></a><a href="#footnote268a"
class="citation">[268a]</a> when narrating his travels in
Scotland, and in describing one of the places of public
entertainment, he calls it &ldquo;a poorer house than any upon
Handforth Green;&rdquo; and again <a name="citation268b"></a><a
href="#footnote268b" class="citation">[268b]</a> he afterwards
states that he had been in a small tavern in Ireland, &ldquo;a
little low thatched Irish house, not to be compared unto Jane
Kelsall&rsquo;s, of the Green at Handforth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation268c"></a><a href="#footnote268c"
class="citation">[268c]</a>&nbsp; Her cottage has disappeared,
and the Green has long been enclosed: no appearance of either of
them now remains, and it may be a question whether portions of
the railway and its station do not stand on what was once the
south-eastern end of the Green; it is, however, to a certain
degree, preserved from oblivion, by the field enclosed from its
site, being still called the Green Field.</p>
<p>Handford is also sometimes known by the names of Hanford,
Honford, Handforth, Handford-cum-Bosden, and Handforth-cum-Bosden
(Handford being a joint township with the township of
Bosden).&nbsp; Some centuries ago the manor and estate of
Handford belonged to the ancient family of Handford of Handford;
then, by marriage, to that of Brereton, in the reign of
Elizabeth; <a name="citation268d"></a><a href="#footnote268d"
class="citation">[268d]</a> they afterwards passed, under a deed
of settlement, to that of Booth, Sir William Brereton having, in
the reign of Charles II., settled them, in default of male issue
of his son, on Nathaniel Booth, Esq., of Mottram St. Andrew, in
tail male; but the estate did not remain any considerable time
with the Booths, and it soon became subdivided amongst various
proprietors.&nbsp; The manorial rights, however, remained a much
longer period with the Booths; the manor having been sold and
conveyed, in 1766, by Nathaniel, Baron Delamer, formerly
Nathaniel Booth, Esq., and others, to Edward Wrench, Esq., of
Chester; in 1805, it was again sold, to Mr. Joseph Cooper, of
Handford; and, in 1808, it was once more sold, by the devisees in
trust under his will, to Mr. William Pass, of Altrincham.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>The
family of Brereton, and also those of Grosvenor and Davenport,
are mentioned by Ormerod, in his <i>History of Cheshire</i>, as
families which can be proved, by ancient deeds, to have existed
at or near the time of the Conquest.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to give a full historical account of the old
family of Brereton, especially as some very interesting
particulars respecting it, have been recently given by Sir
Fortunatus Dwarris, in a paper, read before the Society of
Antiquaries. <a name="citation269a"></a><a href="#footnote269a"
class="citation">[269a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Randle Brereton, of
Shocklach and Malpas Hall, in Cheshire, grandson of the founder
of that branch, was Chamberlain of Chester, in the 19th and 20th
years of the reign of Henry VII., and one of the Knights of the
body to that King.&nbsp; He is mentioned generally as Chamberlain
to Henry VII., in the 21st year of that monarch&rsquo;s reign,
and that he held that office twenty-six years, to the 23rd of
Henry VIII., by whom he was made a Knight Banneret, as a reward
for his conduct at Terouenne and Tournay.&nbsp; He built the
Brereton Chapel <a name="citation269b"></a><a
href="#footnote269b" class="citation">[269b]</a> in the Church of
Malpas, in 1522, where he was buried, leaving issue nine sons and
three daughters. <a name="citation269c"></a><a
href="#footnote269c" class="citation">[269c]</a></p>
<p>Sir Randle Brereton&rsquo;s second and ninth sons were
founders respectively of the Tatton and the Handford branches of
the Breretons.&nbsp; His seventh son succeeded his father as
Chamberlain of Chester, and was Groom of the Chamber to King
Henry VIII.&nbsp; He married Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Earl
of Worcester, widow of Sir John Savage, and was beheaded, upon a
most questionable charge of criminal intercourse with Queen Anne
Boleyn, in 1536, when he was twenty-eight years of age, and a
young married man.&nbsp; It may be noticed incidentally that
Queen Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s favourite lap-dog (an Italian
greyhound) was named Urian, the name of a brother of the Groom of
the Chamber, and a family name in the Malpas Hall <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>branch of
the Brereton family, derived from the early Barons of
Malpas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trifles light as air are to the jealous
confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Urian Brereton, the ninth son of Sir Randle Brereton, of
the Shocklach and Malpas Hall branch, married Margaret, the
daughter and sole heiress of William Handford, Esq., of
Handford.&nbsp; His son, grandson, and great-grandson, were all
of the name of William; and it was the latter (Sir William
Brereton, Bart.), who was the distinguished Parliamentarian
general, <a name="citation270a"></a><a href="#footnote270a"
class="citation">[270a]</a> and whose achievements are so well
known to persons who have devoted their attention to the unhappy
war between Charles I. and the Parliament, in which&mdash;now
that the excess of party-heat has long ago subsided, and the
history of those times can be dispassionately
considered&mdash;there is too much reason to believe that both
parties were in the wrong.&nbsp; His notorious aversion to church
government, noticed by Clarendon, was probably heightened by
circumstances; but he appears, by his early travels, to have been
always of a sober, serious, and religious turn of mind, with a
<i>penchant</i> for spicy sermons.&nbsp; He married a daughter of
Sir George Booth, who was considered the cornerstone of the
Presbyterian interest in Cheshire, and is described by writers of
the day as &ldquo;free, grave, godly, brave Booth, the flower of
Cheshire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir William Brereton was also the friend
and neighbour of Henry Bradshaw, of Colonel Duckinfield, and of
Lenthall; the latter of whom afterwards married his
daughter.&nbsp; The cruel and unjust execution of the Groom of
the Chamber, by Henry VIII., rankled in the breasts of his family
and connections; the imposition of ship-money had led Sir William
Brereton into collision with the citizens of Chester; and he had
disputes with the church and corporation of that city, about
exemptions from tolls, and for murage, on account of his lands of
St. Mary&rsquo;s Nunnery in Chester, granted by the Crown to his
family.</p>
<p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>The
before-mentioned William Brereton, of Handford, was created a
Baronet in 1626&ndash;7, and the title became extinct on the
death of Sir Thomas Brereton, Bart., in 1673. <a
name="citation271a"></a><a href="#footnote271a"
class="citation">[271a]</a></p>
<p>A copy of the principal portion of the Pedigree of the
Breretons, of Handford, <a name="citation271b"></a><a
href="#footnote271b" class="citation">[271b]</a> so far as is
necessary to elucidate the subject, will be given afterwards.</p>
<p>Another branch of this ancient family was that of the
Breretons, of Brereton Hall, Cheshire.&nbsp; It is, however,
foreign to the purpose to go into any particulars with respect to
that branch, here, further than to mention, that that branch was
ennobled; and, as a proof of the divisions which existed in some
of the principal families during the disastrous period of the
civil war, Lord Brereton, of the latter branch, eminently
distinguished himself by his devotion to the opposite cause, and
raised troops and ventured his life and property on the part of
King Charles I.&nbsp; Lord Brereton was taken prisoner, with his
wife and son; he suffered sequestration of his estates, and was
ultimately reduced to compound for them, and to pay a composition
for his son.&nbsp; After the restoration, Lord Brereton was
associated with the Earl of Derby, in the Lord Lieutenancy of the
county of Chester; he was also member for the county in the first
Parliament ensuing, as many of the members of his family had been
in prior Parliaments. <a name="citation271c"></a><a
href="#footnote271c" class="citation">[271c]</a></p>
<p>The old hall at Handford, formerly the residence of the
Breretons, lies nearly half a mile from and on the south-eastward
side of the village, and is approached, after crossing the bridge
built over the railway before mentioned, by a lane lending from
thence into a pleasant and picturesque valley, through which a
small brook runs, and after crossing it we arrive at the old
hall.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>This
mansion, like many others situated in various parts of Cheshire,
is principally built of timber and plaster, the timber being
disposed in squares, which are filled up with plaster.&nbsp; At
the front or main door is a porch, the entrance to which is under
a beam of oak, supported at each end by a very large beam, of
that wood.&nbsp; On the transverse beam, which forms what may be
considered a kind of arch, at the entrance, the following
inscription is carved, in Old English characters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This haulle was buylded in the yeare of
oure Lord God <span class="GutSmall">MCCCCCLXII</span> by Uryan
Breretoun Knight whom maryed Margaret daughter and heyre of
Wyllyam Handforth of Handforthe Esquye and had issue <span
class="GutSmall">III</span> sonnes and <span
class="GutSmall">II</span> daughters&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underneath the inscription, and on each side of the arch of
the porch, are as follows:&mdash;On one side the letter V (for
Urian), and on the other the letter B (for Brereton), and between
them, on a border running along the arch, is carved a tun or cask
(in the centre), and also a brier, the stem and foliage of which
extend, on each side, from the tun to the before-mentioned
letters; evidently a rebus punning upon the word
&ldquo;Brereton&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Brier-tun&rdquo;).&nbsp; At the
upper part of the door-post of the porch, on the left-hand side,
is an escutcheon with the arms of Brereton impaling those of
Handford.&nbsp; Ormerod calls it &ldquo;the coat of arms of
Brereton quartering Ipstones, and impaling Handford,&rdquo; and
adds, &ldquo;Brereton has for difference a cross crosslet between
the bars, and a crescent on the first bar.&rdquo; <a
name="citation272a"></a><a href="#footnote272a"
class="citation">[272a]</a>&nbsp; The last time that I visited
the hall was on the 11th January, 1849, and then, possibly in
consequence of the wearing effects of time and weather on the
coat of arms, I was not able to discover any crescent, but I did
distinguish the cross crosslet.&nbsp; I could discern that there
were some quarterings on the dexter side, but they were so
impaired by time, that except those of Brereton proper, I could
not clearly distinguish them. <a name="citation272b"></a><a
href="#footnote272b" class="citation">[272b]</a>&nbsp; The arms
of <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>Brereton are &ldquo;Argent two bars sable, a crescent
gules&rdquo; <a name="citation273a"></a><a href="#footnote273a"
class="citation">[273a]</a> (on the first bar); crest, &ldquo;a
bear&rsquo;s head and neck, erased sable, muzzled gules.&rdquo;
<a name="citation273a"></a><a href="#footnote273a"
class="citation">[273a]</a>&nbsp; The arms of Handford (which are
impaled with those of Brereton), are first and fourth, sable, a
star argent pierced of the field, for Handford proper; second and
third, gules, a scythe argent, for Praers; <a
name="citation273b"></a><a href="#footnote273b"
class="citation">[273b]</a> with which family the Handfords had
formerly intermarried.&nbsp; The wife&rsquo;s arms are nearly
perfect, and are plain to the sight, the sinister side of the
carved escutcheon having suffered less than the dexter side: both
sides are, however, too much worn to enable me to distinguish the
metals or colours, even if the marks of discrimination were then
used, or to decide whether the star (for Handford) was
&ldquo;pierced of the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the upper part of the corresponding or right door-post is
the crest of the Breretons, a bear&rsquo;s head and neck erased
muzzled. <a name="citation273c"></a><a href="#footnote273c"
class="citation">[273c]</a>&nbsp; The fronts of the door-posts of
the porch have also been ornamented with carving; and the
before-mentioned border with the brier is also continued down to
the ground, on each of the door-posts.</p>
<p>This mansion is stated by Ormerod to have originally formed a
quadrangle, but I could not satisfy myself, by inspection,
whether that had been the case, although it is clear that it was
<a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>once
much larger than it now is.&nbsp; Early in 1849, in digging a
drain in front of the hall, in a place which had been part of a
garden, some human bones were found, with some wood, possibly
parts of coffins, conveying an impression as if there had once
been a place of interment there; but the remains were
inconsiderable, and the researches were not pursued by any
further excavation.&nbsp; There were persons, who have not been
very long dead, who used to say that there had been grave-stones
existing as late as in the last century, close to the hall.&nbsp;
Traces of foundations have also been formerly discovered at the
hall, conjectured to have formed part of a chapel; of course such
a conjecture must be received with caution; as the mansion was
once considerably larger, it does not follow that they may not
have formed part of the foundations of other parts of it.</p>
<p>The hall has long been used as a farm-house, and belongs to
the Rev. Henry Wright, of Mottram St. Andrew.</p>
<p>The brook before mentioned is one of the tributaries of a
small river, called the Dean, and flows upon part of an estate at
Handford, called the Brooke Farm, belonging to my father, Richard
Brooke, Esq., <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a> and which has been for a very long
period in my family.&nbsp; The brook separates that estate in
part from the adjoining one held with the hall, belonging to the
Rev. Henry Wright.&nbsp; Some indications of fishponds and
terraces may be seen in part of the field, which slopes down from
the hall, towards the brook, conveying strongly the idea of the
spot having been the site of a garden or pleasure-ground.&nbsp;
As a proof how indifferent and inattentive the families of high
consideration in the county were, in comparatively recent times,
to many of the conveniences and requisites which respectable
families now consider indispensable, I may observe, that the only
road from the highway and village to the hall, crossed the brook,
and that there was not any bridge there until about <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>1846 or
1847. <a name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275"
class="citation">[275]</a>&nbsp; The Breretons must consequently
have been obliged to cross it on horseback, or on
stepping-stones, or have waded through it; and though the brook
is quiet, and very shallow in dry weather, it is liable to rise
and become much swollen after heavy rains, as I have more than
once seen; and the act of crossing it in the dark, and after a
continuance of wet weather, must have been a feat frequently
attended not merely with much inconvenience, but with some
danger.&nbsp; That circumstance may be mentioned, as exhibiting a
feature in the habits of the country gentry of consideration in
Cheshire, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the
Breretons resided at the hall.</p>
<p>The interior of Handford Hall has been much changed, and the
rooms considerably altered; the alterations, however useful they
may be to a farmer, are sad desecrations in the eyes of an
antiquary; but still something remains to interest the
latter.&nbsp; The staircase is of oak, and is wide and handsome,
with highly ornamented flat balusters, the upper part of which is
curiously carved in open work, so as to form rather small and
round-headed arches, cut through the wood, in a style
occasionally used in the times of Elizabeth and James I.&nbsp;
Above the arches are carved ornaments, not unlike lozenges, and
the balustrade is surmounted with a heavy carved handrail, all of
oak; and the whole balustrade, though handsomer than that of Soss
Moss Hall, described by me in a former paper, has some
resemblance to it.&nbsp; On the landing on the first floor, at
the head of the stairs, is a large folding door, each fold of
which is laid out in panels, on the lowest of which were formerly
four ornaments of <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, placed at the top,
bottom, and on each side respectively; and each four pointing
towards the centre of the panel; several of these
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i> ornaments still remain.&nbsp; Above them are
other panels, each decorated with four lozenge-shaped <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>ornaments,
also disposed so that each points to the centre.&nbsp; I was
struck with the resemblance to the lozenge-shaped carved
ornaments which are to be seen on the pulpit of Wilmslow Church,
only a mile distant from Handford, and mentioned in a former
paper.&nbsp; The folding door before mentioned, opened into what
was the principal apartment on that floor, but which is now quite
stripped of all appearance of antiquity.&nbsp; Several windows of
the old hall have been modernized, but there are still some of
them remaining, apparently as they have been for many
generations, with small squares of glass let into lead, such as
may be seen in many old houses.</p>
<p>There are several modern additions of brick, and other
alterations in the hall, which detract from its appearance; still
it has an air of antiquity, and correctly conveys the impression
of having been the residence of a family of importance.</p>
<p>The chapel-of-ease, before mentioned, in the village of
Handford, was built in 1837, by subscription of the landowners
there, and of other benevolent persons; the scheme having been
set on foot and much assisted by the exertions of the Rev. Edward
Trafford Leigh, the then rector of Cheadle, in which parish it is
situated.</p>
<p>A handsome brick viaduct of the Railway crosses a picturesque
valley at Handford, through which the river Dean flows; and,
after joining the Bollin near Wilmslow, the combined rivers fall
into the Mersey, near Altrincham.</p>
<p>The place of interment of the Breretons of Handford was in the
parish church of Cheadle, distant nearly four miles from the
hall.&nbsp; The church is in the village of Cheadle, and is an
old stone edifice of the Gothic style of architecture, with a
chancel, a clerestory, a nave with four pointed arches on each
side, resting on octagonal pillars, and with side aisles.&nbsp;
It has a square tower, with six bells.&nbsp; It is a rectory
which has for many years been in the patronage of the Broughtons;
and the present rector is the Rev. Charles James Cummings.</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>There
is a striking general resemblance between the churches of
Cheadle, Wilmslow, and Bowdon, all in the same part of Cheshire;
and they all appear to have been rebuilt, or considerably
altered, or repaired, not long before the Reformation; and
tradition says, that all three were repaired or rebuilt at the
same time, which receives considerable corroboration, not merely
from the resemblance in the appearance and style of the churches,
but also from the fact, that an inscription, which I saw a few
years ago, and which probably still remains, on the stained glass
of a window at Bowdon Church, mentions the name of a prior of
Birkenhead, the last or one of the last priors of that place, who
is stated in the inscription, to have presented the window to the
church.</p>
<p>The church at Cheadle is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; A
chapel, called the Handford Chapel, is on the south side of the
church.&nbsp; In this chapel is a large altar tomb, on which are
recumbent marble figures of two knights or personages, in
complete plate armour, of a very richly ornamented style, and
each with his hands conjoined; one bare-headed, but with the head
resting on a helmet, which is so injured that it cannot be
clearly ascertained whether it had any crest; the other figure
has a helmet, which is ornamented with a wreath and a fillet, and
has a crest, seemingly the head of some animal, but of which
there are not sufficient remains to show whether it was the head
of a bird or beast, but it is said to have been that of a
hind.&nbsp; Each of the figures is decorated with a collar of SS,
and the feet of each rest upon a lion.&nbsp; Another altar tomb
is placed close up to and on the north side of the tomb, but on
rather a lower elevation; on it is a third figure, in stone, with
some truces of its having been painted; it is the effigy of
another personage, in plate armour, but instead of greaves, it
has rather small jack-boots, and is bare-headed, with long
flowing hair; and, what seems very remarkable in such an effigy,
instead of a gorget, it has a neckcloth or cravat, tied, with the
ends of it falling down over the upper part of the
cuirasse.&nbsp; The head also <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>rests upon a helmet with a plume of
feathers, coloured blue, white, and red: the feet do not rest
upon any animal.</p>
<p>On the north side of this tomb is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Here lyeth the body of
S<sup>r.</sup> Thomas<br />
Brereton of Handforth Barronett<br />
who married Theodosia, Daughter<br />
to the Right Honourable Humble<br />
Lord Ward and the Lady Frances<br />
Barronesse Dudley, hee departed<br />
this life the 7th of January<br />
Anno Dom: 1673<br />
&AElig;tatis Su&aelig; 43.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the dexter side of that inscription is a shield of the arms
of Brereton, before described, with the badge of Baronetcy; the
crescent gules, before mentioned, appears on the first bar in the
arms, but there is not the cross crosslet (before adverted to, in
noticing the arms at Handford Hall); and on the sinister side is
a shield of the arms of Ward, &ldquo;chequy, or and azure, a bend
ermine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The east and south sides of the monument are
so close to the walls, that it is impossible to ascertain what
they contain by way of inscriptions or heraldic devices; and the
same remark applies to the west end, where the side of a pew
completely precludes all examination.&nbsp; All the three
effigies are said to be those of Breretons, and there does not
seem to be any fair doubt of the fact.&nbsp; The tombs seem to
have been removed to their present position, as it is scarcely
probable that they were originally crowded close to each other,
and to the walls, as they now are.</p>
<p>In the east window of the Handford Chapel is a mutilated
shield of arms, in stained glass; the parts remaining are, as far
as I could distinguish, as follows:&mdash;On the dexter side, on
a chief azure, three bucks&rsquo; heads caboshed, or, for Stanley
(the rest of the dexter side is so much injured that it cannot be
distinguished); impaling the arms of a female, evidently one of
the Handfords, of which only the following quarterings remain
distinguishable, <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>viz.: second, gules, a scythe argent, for Praers;
fourth, sable, a star, with six or eight rays (it is not easy to
distinguish the number), argent, for Handford; the crest is
rather defaced, but seems to be an eagle&rsquo;s head erased,
holding in its beak an eagle&rsquo;s leg and claws erased.</p>
<p>Ormerod describes the arms in the window, as the arms of
&ldquo;Stanley impaling Handford, on a chief engrailed azure,
three bucks or; impaling Handford, first and fourth, sable, a
star of six rays argent; second and third, gules, a scythe
argent, Praers; crest, an eagle&rsquo;s head erased or, holding
in the mouth a claw gules.&rdquo; <a name="citation279a"></a><a
href="#footnote279a" class="citation">[279a]</a>&nbsp; It is
probable that the stained glass (with the arms) was more perfect
when Ormerod wrote, than at present; but he seems to have fallen
into an error, in mentioning three &ldquo;bucks&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;bucks&rsquo; heads&rdquo; on the chief.&nbsp; On the
dexter side of the arms is the inscription &ldquo;Vanitas
vanitatum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chapel has a carved oak screen or
frame-work, enclosing it on the west and north sides, with some
carving, not very dissimilar to lace-work, but much injured; with
a cornice containing the before-mentioned rebus, of a brier and a
tun, for Brereton, repeated thirteen times, with the initial
letters V and B between each alternately, for &ldquo;Urian&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Brereton,&rdquo; on the north side, but the rebus has
been destroyed on the west side. <a name="citation279b"></a><a
href="#footnote279b" class="citation">[279b]</a>&nbsp; At the
bottom of the screen, on each of those sides, are panels, carved
so as to resemble drapery, in upright folds, with two arrows
showing themselves upon the drapery on one or two of the panels,
and which probably may also have formerly appeared on some of the
others.</p>
<p>On the north side of the church is the part called the Mosely
Chapel, and sometimes called the Bamford Chapel, which has <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>on the
south and west sides a screen or frame-work of carved oak, of a
plainer style, and apparently of an older date, than that of the
Handford Chapel.&nbsp; It is much mutilated, and there are on it
traces of an inscription, in the old characters, of which only a
few letters are still visible and legible; but I was informed, by
Mr. George Smith, the clerk, that the pulpit, which has been
removed, and placed close to the screen, now conceals other
imperfect portions of the inscription, which, however, he had
previously carefully copied (a measure highly creditable to him),
and that the imperfect portions which exist, are as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;rginis &mdash; &mdash; artu mil&#299;mo
&mdash; u&#299;g&#275;tismo XXIX&rdquo;; the latter being meant
for the date&mdash;millesimo quingentesimo undetricesimo
(1529).</p>
<p>The roof of the church is of oak, supported by elaborately
carved oak beams, with cross rafters, also handsomely carved, and
with bosses at the intersecting points of the rafters; in several
places the etoiles or stars, similar to those mentioned in my
account of Wilmslow Church, are also carved on the bosses.&nbsp;
Some modern bosses have been recently introduced in the roof of
the chancel, and of the side aisles, where the old ones had
disappeared; they have been carved in good taste by Mr. Smith, in
strict conformity with the remaining ancient ones; he is not only
the clerk of the church, but also a mason, and the Gothic font,
which was presented by him, and is now used in the church, is of
his design and workmanship.</p>
<p>On the east window, which has been sadly altered for the
worse, is a mutilated inscription, in stained glass (which may,
however, have originally belonged to a much older window), with
the date 1556.</p>
<p>The chancel is separated from the nave by a slight screen of
carved oak, nearly denuded of all ornament, which seems to have
been the lower part of the rood-loft, the upper portion having
been long since destroyed.</p>
<p>On a grave-stone near the altar is a small brass plate, with
<a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>the arms
of Bulkeley, three bulls&rsquo; heads couped, and the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Humphridus Bulkeley Armiger,
Filius et H&aelig;res Richardi Bulkeley, Armigeri, et
Katherin&aelig; Uxoris, Fili&aelig; Georgii Nedham de Thornset,
in comitatu Derbi&aelig; Armigeri; Richardus Filius fuit
primogenitus Richardi Bulkeley, Militis de Beaumaris et Cheadle
per uxorem priorem; Humphridus Bulkeley pr&aelig;dictus obiit
octavo die Septembris, anno Domini, 1678.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the style and appearance of the present east or altar
window, it is very probable that it was made during some general
alterations and repairs of the church in the seventeenth
century&mdash;a supposition which receives some corroboration
from the date, 1634, which has been put upon the church porch;
and it presents us with another striking and lamentable proof of
the ignorance of many of the persons to whom the repair of our
churches has been intrusted, and of the debased and retrograde
state of the science of church architecture which prevailed at
one period:&mdash;an ugly square-looking window, with little
cottage panes of glass, not unlike those often seen in country
schools, is put in the place where, no doubt, there was formerly
a handsome Gothic altar window. <a name="citation281a"></a><a

OFFICE OF KEEPER OF THE ROYAL MENAGERIE,<br />
IN THE REIGN OF EDWARD IV. <a name="citation283a"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">Letter</span> from Richard Brooke, Esq.,
F.S.A., to Sir Henry Ellis, K.H., F.R.S., Secretary to the
Society of Antiquaries of London, upon the office of Keeper of
the Royal Menagerie in the Tower of London, in the reign of
Edward IV.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Liverpool</i>,
17<i>th</i> <i>November</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I have been recently much interested,
in reading Mr. Collier&rsquo;s <i>Annals of the Stage</i>.&nbsp;
My curiosity was excited, by the passage in vol. i. pp. 35 and
36, in which he gives in a note, a copy from the <i>Harl.
MSS.</i>, No. 433, of a warrant of 1st Richard III., <a
name="citation283b"></a><a href="#footnote283b"
class="citation">[283b]</a> to John Brown, appointing him keeper
of the King&rsquo;s bears and apes; and Mr. Collier there slates,
that if a keeper of those animals were known before the reign of
Richard the Third, he is not aware of any earlier record of his
existence, as a licensed court officer.&nbsp; On reading the
passage, I felt a <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>strong impression, that the <i>Rotuli
Parliamentorum</i> contained proofs of the existence, at an
earlier date than that reign, of an officer of a similar
description, to the one alluded to by Mr. Collier.&nbsp; Although
I have not succeeded in discovering, that any person is
previously mentioned, as being the keeper, by royal authority, of
bears and apes in England, I have discovered in the 5th vol. of
the <i>Rotuli Parliamentorum</i>, proofs in three different
instances, in the reign of Edward IV.; one of which is as early
as 1461, of the fact of a keeper (Ralph Hastings, Esq.), having
been appointed, by letters patent of that King, to what would, in
more modern times, be called the Royal Menagerie, in the Tower of
London.&nbsp; Lions and lionesses are there mentioned, as being
kept in the Tower, in all the three instances; and leopards are
mentioned in the first of them.&nbsp; As Edward IV. only came to
the throne on the 4th of March, 1461, and as the references to
the grant of the office are worded in a commonplace manner, as if
it were nothing extraordinary, it is only fair to presume, that
the keeping of foreign animals in the Tower, and the appointment
of an officer to have the custody of them, not only existed in
the reign of Edward IV., but may have occurred at least as far
back as the reign of Henry VI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable that the passages in the <i>Rotuli
Parliamentorum</i>, to which I have alluded, are well known to
many of our Society, still there may be some who are not aware of
them; and I am induced to subjoin extracts, and request them to
be read before the Society, under the impression that all
information of this nature is useful, as tending to give us an
insight into the customs and habits of an age gone by.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I remain, dear Sir,</p>

<p>The Act of Resumption of 4th Edward IV., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1464 (<i>Rot. Parl.</i> vol. v. fo.
533), contains a very similar proviso and reservation of the
office, in favour of the before-mentioned Ralph Hastings, except
that it does not mention the leopards, and that the allowance is
stated to be 16<i>d.</i> a day, instead of 1<i>s.</i>, for fees
for himself, besides what was also allowed for the keep of the
lions and lionesses.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from the act:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;of any graunte made by us to hym by any of

<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

elucidated, in some degree, by another passage, which occurs in
the subsequent act of 7th and 8th Edward IV., as will be next
noticed; and that 6<i>d.</i> a day was allowed for the keep of
each lion, &amp;c.: no trifling sum at that time.</p>

besides a further allowance for the keep of the animals.&nbsp; It
provides that the act should not prejudice the grant to Ralph
Hastings, of the office&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> descriptions of wild
animals were, at one period, inhabitants of Great Britain, which,
with the increase of population and civilization, have become
extinct, amongst which may be mentioned, the wolf, bear, <a
name="citation287b"></a><a href="#footnote287b"
class="citation">[287b]</a> and wild boar. <a
name="citation287c"></a><a href="#footnote287c"
class="citation">[287c]</a>&nbsp; We may, however, <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>perhaps
regret the extinction of other animals, which were not of a
destructive kind; for example, the beaver <a
name="citation288a"></a><a href="#footnote288a"
class="citation">[288a]</a> is generally admitted by naturalists,
to have been, and the roe deer certainly was, formerly, a native
of England.&nbsp; The beaver is no longer to be found amongst us;
and the roe deer is not now to be met with in any part of this
country to the south of Scotland: the latter, however, remained
wild in England and Wales, until the reign of King Henry VIII. <a
name="citation288b"></a><a href="#footnote288b"
class="citation">[288b]</a>&nbsp; The fox would probably have
also disappeared ere now, if it had not been for his superior
cunning, and his conducing to the sports of the field; the otter
is become rather scarce; and the seal is now rarely found upon
the coasts of England.&nbsp; The poor harmless badger, although
still occasionally met with in some unenclosed or wild parts,
has, notwithstanding his inoffensive and unobtrusive habits, been
exterminated in several of the English counties, and is become
rare in most of them.</p>
<p>The inquiries pursued in this paper will, however, be with
reference to the wolf only.</p>
<p>It is admitted by all writers upon the natural history of the
British Isles, that wolves once abounded in England, Wales,
Scotland, and Ireland; and it is an interesting circumstance,
that we know with tolerable exactness, something of the dates of
their extinction in Scotland and Ireland.&nbsp; The last wolf
that is known to have been wild in Scotland, was killed about the
year 1680; <a name="citation288c"></a><a href="#footnote288c"
class="citation">[288c]</a> and the last presentment for killing
wolves in Ireland, was made in the county of Cork, about the year
1710. <a name="citation288d"></a><a href="#footnote288d"
class="citation">[288d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>It is
remarkable, that when Buffon wrote in the last century, he or
Daubenton, who assisted him, did not believe that wolves had
become extinct in Great Britain.&nbsp; The following remarkable
passage occurs in Button&rsquo;s <i>Natural
History</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Les Anglais pretendent en avoir
purg&eacute; leur Isle, cependant on m&rsquo;a assur&eacute;, qu
&rsquo;il y en avait en Ecosse.&nbsp; Comme il y a peu de bois,

<i>Natural History</i>, vol. vii. p. 50, title &ldquo;Du
Loup&rdquo;; in which work Buffon was assisted by Daubenton, the
naturalist.&nbsp; As Buffon was born in 1707, and Daubenton in
1716, it is quite possible that one or both of them, received the
information upon that point, from some person, who had lived in
Scotland, before the extinction of wolves in that country; and,
consequently, it might easily be believed by either of them, that
wolves were to be found there, at the time when that passage was
written.</p>
<p>Holinshed wrote his <i>Chronicles</i> in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth; and he mentions, that wolves then abounded in
Scotland:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First of all therefore in the fields and
wild places of the country, there is great plenty of hares, red
deere, fallow deere, roes, wild horsses, wolves and
foxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wolves are most fierce and noisome to the heards
and flocks, in all parts of Scotland, saving in one parcell of
Angus, called Glennorsdale, where these beasts doo no manner of
hurt unto the domesticall catell, but preie onlie upon the
wild.&rdquo;&mdash;Holinshed&rsquo;s <i>Chronicles</i>,
<i>Description of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also know from Camden, who likewise wrote in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, that at the time when he wrote, wolves were very
common in Scotland. <a name="citation289"></a><a
href="#footnote289" class="citation">[289]</a>&nbsp; He also
informs us in another place, that Scotland was &ldquo;grievously
infested with fierce wolves, which <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>not only make dreadful havoc of
cattle, but even fall upon men, with such inveteracy and
mischief, not only in this but in many other parts of Scotland,
that by act of Parliament, the sheriffs and inhabitants in every
county, are obliged to go out three times a year, to destroy the
wolves and their young ones.&rdquo; <a name="citation290a"></a><a
href="#footnote290a" class="citation">[290a]</a></p>
<p>We also learn from Camden, that at that time, Ireland swarmed
with wolves. <a name="citation290b"></a><a href="#footnote290b"
class="citation">[290b]</a></p>
<p>Although it appears to be known with some degree of certainty,
about what period they ceased to exist in Scotland and Ireland,
there is a great difficulty in ascertaining, at what date they
became extinct in England; and in consequence of its greater
population, its not having many mountainous and wild districts,
and, as suggested in Buffon&rsquo;s work, its not having
extensive woods, it is certain, that wolves would be much sooner
exterminated in England, than in Scotland or Ireland.</p>
<p>At the time of the Anglo-Saxon sway, wolves abounded in great
numbers in England; and in the tenth century, in the reign of
Athelstan, a place of retreat was erected at Flixton, in
Yorkshire, in order to protect travellers from being devoured by
wolves. <a name="citation290c"></a><a href="#footnote290c"
class="citation">[290c]</a></p>
<p>It has been said, that in the reign of Edgar, also in the
tenth century, an annual tribute was imposed upon the Welsh
princes, of three hundred wolves&rsquo; heads, in order to effect
their destruction.&nbsp; If that be true, it is only reasonable
to suppose, that considerable numbers would be destroyed, by the
adoption of that expedient; but it is strange that some authors,
copying from one another, and without giving themselves the
trouble of searching into authorities, have stated, that the
extinction of wolves in England and Wales was caused by it.&nbsp;
Nothing can be further from the truth, as will be presently
shown.&nbsp; Mr. Hume, in his <i>History of England</i>, indeed,
even goes far beyond other writers, in his unqualified assertions
on that subject, without any <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>proof; and shows, as is too often
the case in his work, his ignorance of the authorities relative
to it; and he has not adduced, and in fact he seems to have been
unable to adduce, any authority for making the following
assertion, viz.:&mdash;&ldquo;Another remarkable incident of this
[Edgar&rsquo;s] reign, was the extirpation of wolves from
England.&nbsp; This advantage was attained by the industrious
policy of Edgar.&nbsp; He took great pains in hunting and
pursuing those ravenous animals; and when he found that all that
escaped him had taken shelter in the mountains and forests of
Wales, he changed the tribute of money imposed on the Welsh
princes by Athelstan his predecessor, into an annual tribute of
three hundred heads of wolves; which produced such diligence in
hunting them, that the animal has been no more seen in this
island.&rdquo; <a name="citation291a"></a><a href="#footnote291a"
class="citation">[291a]</a>&nbsp; It is surprising that Mr. Hume
should have ventured to make an assertion so easily refuted; and
it is remarkable, that his <i>History of England</i> should find
a prominent place in so many libraries, when it is now admitted,
that its author is very frequently incorrect as a historian, and
that the statements in it, when he omits, as he often does, to
quote authorities, cannot be relied on.&nbsp; That work has never
been regularly reviewed, which ought even yet to be done.&nbsp;
Lord Brougham, in his <i>Lives of Men of Letters and Science</i>,
who flourished in the time of George III., very properly exposes
the faults and incorrectness of Mr. Hume&rsquo;s <i>History of
England</i>, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is continual proof, that he took what
he found set down in former works, without weighing the relative
value of conflicting authorities, and generally resorted to the
most accessible sources of information.&nbsp; There have been
instances without number, adduced of his inaccuracy in citing
even the authorities to which he confined his researches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can we acquit him on another charge, not rarely
brought against him, and partaking of the two former: neglect or
carelessness about the truth, and infidelity in relating
it.&rdquo; <a name="citation291b"></a><a href="#footnote291b"

<p><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>The
Abbey of Fors, in Wensleydale, in Yorkshire, was founded in the
year 1145, which is nearly two centuries after the reign of
Edgar; and some time afterwards, Alan Earl of Bretagne, gave to
the monks of that abbey the privilege of taking, by themselves or
their servants, the remains of the deer which had been killed and
partly devoured by the wolves, in the forest of Wensleydale. <a

<p>In the 10th year of the reign of William I. (1075), Robert de
Hurfravill, lord of Tours and Vian, otherwise called Robert with
the Beard, being a kinsman to the King, obtained from him a grant
of the lordship, valley, and forest of Riddesdale, in the county
of Northumberland, with all the castles, manors, lands, woods,
pastures, waters, pools, and royal franchises, which were
formerly possessed by Mildred, the son of Akman, late lord of
Riddesdale, and which came to that king upon his conquest of
England, to hold, by the service of defending that part of the
country, for ever, from enemies, and wolves. <a

<p>In the 1st year of King John (1199), he granted to William
Briwere, a license, &ldquo;to hunt the hare, fox, cat, and wolf,
throughout all Devonshire; and likewise the goat out of the
regard [sight] of the forest; and to have free warren throughout
all his own lands, for hares, pheasants, and partridges.&rdquo;

<p>In the 9th year of Edward I. (1281), wolves existed in such
numbers in several parts of England, that a royal commission was
issued by him, to Peter Corbet, for the destruction, by means of
men, dogs, and engines, of wolves, in all forests, parks, and
other places, in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire,
Shropshire, and Staffordshire; and all bailiffs, &amp;c., were <a

wolves in those counties.</p>
<p>The commission is alluded to by Bingley, the Naturalist; but
it is remarkable that he has altogether omitted to give the date
or any reference, where an account of it was to be found.&nbsp;
Dr. Whitaker does not notice it, although he more than once, in
his <i>History of Craven</i>, adverts to the existence of wolves
in England after the reign of Edgar.&nbsp; As the mandate is a

294</span>Enough has now been stated, for the purpose of showing
that it was an idle tale to assert that the extinction of these
animals occurred in the reign of Edgar.&nbsp; Evidence has been
already adduced to show that they existed here, in a wild state,
a considerable period after the Conquest; but it is the intention
of the author of this paper to go much further, and some proofs
will be brought forward of their being in existence for centuries
after that event; and some conjectures will be hazarded,
respecting the probable period of their final extinction in
England.</p>
<p>In the 25th year of Edward I. (1296), John de Engaine, Lord of
Blatherwic, died, seized of lands in Pightesse, or Pytesse, in
Northamptonshire, found to be held of the King, by service of
hunting the wolf, fox, and badger. <a name="citation294a"></a><a
href="#footnote294a" class="citation">[294a]</a></p>
<p>In the reign of Edward II. (1820), John le Wolfhunt, or
Wolfhurt, son and heir of John le Wolfhunt, or Wolfhurt, held
lands at Wormhill, in Derbyshire, by the service of chasing and
taking all wolves that might come into the King&rsquo;s Forest of
the Peak, in that county. <a name="citation294b"></a><a
href="#footnote294b" class="citation">[294b]</a></p>
<p>In the 11th year of Edward III. (1336), John Lord Roos, of
Hamlake, had a charter granted to him, by the King, of free
warren in lands in Nottinghamshire and Oxfordshire, and also to
hunt the fox, wolf, hare, and cat, throughout the King&rsquo;s
forest of Nottinghamshire. <a name="citation294c"></a><a
href="#footnote294c" class="citation">[294c]</a></p>
<p>In the 33rd year of Edward III. (1358), Vitalis Engaine died,
seized of part of the lordships of Laxton and Pichesse, in
Northamptonshire, held by petit serjeanty, to hunt the wolf
whensoever the King should command. <a name="citation294d"></a><a
href="#footnote294d" class="citation">[294d]</a></p>
<p>In the 41st year of Edward III. (1366), Thomas de Engaine,
Lord of Blatherwic, died, seized of lands, meadows, and rent, in
Pightesse, in Northamptonshire, held by the service of
&ldquo;finding, <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>at his own proper costs, certain dogs, for the
destruction of wolves, foxes, martrons [marten cats], cats [wild
cats], and other vermine,&rdquo; within the counties of
Northampton, Rutland, Oxford, Essex, and Buckingham. <a
name="citation295a"></a><a href="#footnote295a"
class="citation">[295a]</a></p>
<p>Of course it is not pretended, that upon the deaths of any of
the before-mentioned personages, who died seized of lands, held
by the tenure of hunting or destroying wolves, such a tenure is
conclusive evidence that those animals existed at the times of
the deaths of those personages respectively, because it may have
happened that the lands may have descended from father to son,
several times, after the dates of the original royal grants or
charters creating such tenures; still, even in that case, enough
has been shown to prove that they were not extinct until
centuries after the time of King Edgar.&nbsp; Besides which, it
must not be forgotten, that the charter before mentioned, of the
11th year of Edward III. (1836), to John Lord Roos, of Hamlake,
then gave him a license to hunt the wolf in the King&rsquo;s
Forest of Nottinghamshire, &amp;c., which would have been useless
if there had not then been any such animal to hunt.&nbsp; We
therefore have some evidence that wolves existed in England in
the fourteenth century; but it is very probable that they had
been destroyed in the more populous and cultivated counties,
although for more than a century longer they might continue to be
occasionally met with, in the wild and thinly peopled parts of
England, especially in the northern counties.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century they probably became scarce.</p>
<p>In the 14th year of Edward IV. (1474), that monarch invaded
France, and negotiations for a truce were commenced between Louis
XI. and Edward, and we learn, from Baker&rsquo;s
<i>Chronicles</i>, that King Louis then presented Edward with the
handsomest horse which Louis had in his stable, and an ass, and
also &ldquo;a wolf and a wild boar, beasts at that time rare in
England.&rdquo;<a name="citation295b"></a><a href="#footnote295b"
class="citation">[295b]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>Those are the exact words of Baker,
and are very interesting, and, with reference to the objects of
this paper, very valuable.&nbsp; It will be remarked, that he
does not state or insinuate that wolves had been exterminated, or
had ceased to exist in England, but merely that they had then
become rare.&nbsp; We therefore have got so far towards the
latter part of the fifteenth century, and appear not yet to have
reached the period of their extinction.&nbsp; I have read
somewhere, that it is traditionally stated that they were to be
found either in the Forest of Dean or in the Forest of Dartmoor,
as late as in the time of Queen Elizabeth; but unfortunately I
omitted to take a note of the publication in which it was
mentioned; and, although I have since devoted some time in
endeavouring to discover it, I have not yet succeeded.</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and his
allusion to England, and also to wolves, is worthy of notice, as
showing his impression of their having at one period abounded in
England, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,<br />
Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some passages in a very learned and celebrated work&mdash;the
<i>Institutes of the Law of England</i>&mdash;by Sir Edward Coke
(afterwards Lord Chief Justice of England, from that circumstance
often called Lord Coke), who was a lawyer of great talents, in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, will perhaps excite surprise, and
are very important with reference to the subject of this
inquiry.</p>
<p>He was born in 1551; was made Solicitor General by Queen
Elizabeth in 1592, and Attorney General in 1594.&nbsp; He was
appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas by James I.
in 1606, and Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench in 1613.&nbsp; His celebrated works&mdash;the <i>Commentary
upon Sir Thomas Littleton&rsquo;s Treatise</i>, and <i>the
Institutes of the Laws of England</i>&mdash;required vast time
and labour; and it is almost incredible that they could have been
written after he became a judge; and consequently, it may be
admitted, as is generally believed, that they were written whilst
he was at the bar, and in the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>It is
well known that the precincts of the forests in England had
courts of their own, and were governed by different laws from the
rest of England; and of course, in treating upon the laws of this
country, so learned and so accurate a writer, as Coke is admitted
to have been, could not avoid noticing them.&nbsp; In the part of
his <i>Institutes</i> upon the Forest Courts, he describes the
jurisdiction and functions of those tribunals, and the animals to
be met with in the forests of England; and, in the quaint and
peculiar language incident to writers of the time of Queen
Elizabeth, he proceeds to mention the beasts of chase and of the
forest.&nbsp; The following are extracts from his work upon that
subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There be many beasts of the forest by the
laws of the forests of England.&nbsp; The hart in summer, the
hinde in winter, and all that proceed as of them: the buck in
summer, the doe in winter, and the proceed of them; the hare,
male and female, and their proceed; the wild boar, male and
female, and their proceed; and the wolf, male and female, and
their proceed; the fox, male and female, and their proceed; the
martin, male and female; capreolus the roe, as it appeareth
before, is no beast of the forest, but it is a beast of
chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proceads of the hare, the first year a leveret, the
second a hare, the third a great hare.&nbsp; Of a wilde boar: a
pig, a hogge, a hog-stear, a boar, and after a
sanglier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No beast of the forest that is <i>solivagum et
nocivum</i>, is venison, as the fox, the wolf, the martin,
because they be no meat, but <i>caro eorum est
nociva</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as the red deer, the fallow deer, the wilde boar,
and the hare, are venison.&nbsp; Whereupon these two conclusions
in the law of the forest do follow: first, whatsoever beast of
the forest is for the food of man is venison, and therewith
agreeth Virgil, describing a feast:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&lsquo;Implentur veteris
bacchi pinguisq: ferin&aelig;.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation297"></a><a href="#footnote297"
class="citation">[297]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is to be presumed, that a writer, whose works are so
accurate <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>as Coke&rsquo;s are admitted to be, would not have
stated that the wolf was an animal of chase in England, at the
time when he wrote, in the sixteenth century, in the reign of
Elizabeth, if it had then been extinct; and it must be borne in
mind, that he has used the present tense in writing of it; which
it is not likely that he would have done, if he had intended to
write respecting an animal which had formerly been a beast of
chase, but which had ceased to exist in England.&nbsp; We have,
therefore, got to the point, that the wolf may fairly be believed
not to have become extinct in England until at least some time
in, or perhaps soon after, the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; I am,
however, far from contending that it then existed in the southern
or midland counties.&nbsp; On the contrary, it appears probable,
that when Coke wrote, it had become extinct in all parts of
England, except in some few of the most northern counties, of
which two are contiguous to Scotland.&nbsp; In the southern
parts, it may perhaps be presumed to have ceased to exist about,
or soon after, the period of the accession of the Tudors to the
throne; and it will be borne in mind that only seventy-three
years elapsed between the accession of the first of that family,
Henry VII. in 1485, and that of Elizabeth, who was the last of
them, in 1558; and that no very extraordinary change took place
in the cultivation or population of England, during that
period.&nbsp; As we have the clear evidence of writers of such
authenticity as Holinshed and Camden, that in the time of
Elizabeth, all parts of Scotland abounded with wolves, and as
there was nothing to prevent those animals from rambling across
the Border, either in search of prey, or for bringing forth their
young, or in consequence of any other natural instinct, it would
be impossible, at that time, with a scanty population, and with
the desolation incident to the unsettled state of the Borders, to
keep the northern counties of England always free from them, and
to prevent their breeding there. <a name="citation298"></a><a
href="#footnote298" class="citation">[298]</a>&nbsp; Those parts
of <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>England were exposed to the incursions of Borderers and
freebooters from Scotland, whose lawless and dangerous habits
were almost as intolerable to their own countrymen as to the
English, and who principally subsisted by pillage, and rendered
life and property insecure, and, as a natural consequence, those
parts were very thinly inhabited.&nbsp; Many very large districts
in the northern counties consisted of wild wastes, forests,
hills, woody valleys, and swamps, with a very scanty and
semi-barbarous population: disadvantages which militated very
much against the early extermination of savage animals.&nbsp; A
change for the better, however, took place in the population, the
civilization, and the appearance of the country, about the close
of the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; I, however, am not aware that
any English writer, since the time of Coke, has given us any
reason to suppose that wolves were to be found in England after
the termination of her reign.&nbsp; We can scarcely suppose that
Coke was incorrect in mentioning wolves as beasts of chase in
England at the time when he wrote; it seems, however, only
reasonable to believe, under all the circumstances, that they
were at that time extinct in all the southern parts; but that a
few then remained in their fastnesses and retreats in forests,
hills, and wild districts, in some of the northern counties of
England, and especially in the parts adjacent to Scotland, and
furnished employment and sport to the hunters, and that, with the
increase of population and cultivation, the clearing away of
woods and forests, and the more general use of firearms, they at
last became extinct in the northern counties, about the
commencement of the seventeenth century, which was near the
period of the close of the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

Wherfore be it ordeyned, enacted, and established, by the lordes

possessions, hereditaments, &amp;c. &amp;c., which he possessed
on the 20th June, in 2nd Henry VII.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>This
is a most extraordinary statute.&nbsp; It commences with calling
Lord Lovel, the &ldquo;late Lord Lovell,&rdquo; without there
appearing to be any certain proof of his death; and it is
contradictory of the act attainting the Earl of Lincoln and
others (see Appendix No. V.), which alleges, that their forces
amounted to 8000 men, and that the battle took place on the 16th
of June; whilst in this the insurgent troops are only stated to
be 5000, and the 20th of June is mentioned as the day of the
battle.&nbsp; It is also scarcely credible, that the attainder of
Lord Lovel could have been, as alleged, inadvertently omitted in
the former statute; nor is it easy to assign any plausible
reason, why an avaricious sovereign like Henry VII. should allow
eight years to elapse after the insurrection, without passing
this act of attainder, when the unhappy nobleman&rsquo;s large
possessions offered so tempting a bait.&nbsp; Indeed, if
Henry&rsquo;s object, in passing it, were to be enabled legally
to seize upon them, such a statute appears unnecessary, because
Lord Lovel was attainted by the act of 1st Henry VII., for
fighting at Bosworth (see Appendix No. III.); and there is no
reason to suppose that this attainder was ever reversed, or that
he ever submitted himself to allegiance to Henry.</p>
<p>There is a tradition, that Lord Lovel escaped from the field
of battle of Stoke, and took refuge in the north of England, and
there, like Lord Clifford, lived several years in obscurity,
concealed from his enemies; but it does not appear to be
authenticated or supported by any historical authority.</p>

<p>Copy of a Letter given in Banks&rsquo;s <i>Dormant and Extinct
Baronage</i>, vol. ii. p. 321, from William Cowper, Esq., Clerk
of the Parliament.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
right">&ldquo;<i>Hertingfordbury Park</i>, 9<i>th</i>
<i>August</i>, 1737.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I met to&rsquo;ther day with a memorandum I
had made some years ago, perhaps not unworthy your notice.&nbsp;
You may remember that Lord Bacon, in his <i>History of Henry
VII.</i>, giving an account of the battle of Stoke, sais of the
Lord Lovel, who was among the rebels, that he fled, and swame
over the Trent on horseback, but could not recover the further
side by reason of the steepenesse of the banke, and so was
drowned in the river.&nbsp; But another report leaves him not
there, but that he lived long after in a cave or vault.</p>
<p><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>&ldquo;Apropos to this; on the 6th of May, 1728, the
present Duke of Rutland related in my hearing, that about twenty
years then before, viz., in 1708, upon occasion of new laying a
chimney, at Minster Luvel, there was discovered a large vault or
room under ground, in which was the entire skeleton of a man, as
having been sitting at a table, which was before him, with a
book, paper, pen, &amp;c. &amp;c.; in another part of the room
lay a cap, all much mouldered and decayed.&nbsp; Which the family
and others judged to be this Lord Luvel, whose exit has hitherto
been so uncertain.&rdquo;</p>

circumstance is narrated, with the addition, that the clothing of
the body seemed to have been rich; that it was seated in a chair,
with a table and a mass-book before it; and also that, upon the
admission of the air, the body soon fell to dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of course admitted, that Edward at his coronation
ennobled his brothers the Duke of Clarence and Duke of
Gloucester; but Leland appears to have expressed himself either
not clearly, or not with his usual accuracy, with respect to the
dates of the conferring of the titles upon several of the other
personages, before mentioned, as may be easily ascertained by a
reference to the works of Ralph Brooke, or Dugdale; from which it
plainly appears, that although Edward did not forget eventually
to reward many <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>of his supporters and adherents with rank and titles,
yet in some instances several years elapsed, after his
coronation, before they were ennobled, or, as the case might be,
were advanced in the peerage.&rdquo;</p>

disappointment to those who have caused the tablet to be placed
there, to learn that the correctness of their theory is not
admitted by others, still it is only proper to mention, that
there does not appear to be any authority for such a supposition:
indeed, after his remains had been pulled out of the grave and
got rid of at the river, it is not likely that anybody would know

to commence this work with an account of the battle of
Shrewsbury, which was a prelude to, and had so close a relation
to, the wars of York and Lancaster, that it may, without much
impropriety, be considered as one of them.</p>

my subsequent visits to the respective scenes of action, and
derived from other sources, additions in some instances, and
alterations in others, have however been made in several of the
papers.&nbsp; For example: my visits to Towton Field amount
altogether to nine; and since the paper upon it was read before
the meetings of the Society, considerable additional information
has been acquired respecting if, which has naturally caused some
alterations to be made.</p>

Northumberland of that surname, at the coronation of King Richard
II. in 1377.&nbsp; He and Henry Percy his son, called Hotspur,
gained the battle of Hallidown Hill, against the Scotch, in
1402.&nbsp; After the battle of Shrewsbury, being supposed to be
disaffected, he was committed to the Tower of London; but having
been liberated from thence, he, with Lord Bardolph, came out of
Scotland in the ninth year of Henry IV. with considerable forces
against Henry; and at Bramham Moor was encountered by Thomas
Rokeby, sheriff of Yorkshire, where the earl was taken prisoner,
and Lord Bardolph dangerously wounded; and they were brought to
York, where they were both beheaded in 1408.&nbsp; He married two
wives: the first was Margaret, daughter of Ralph Lord Neville of
Raby, by whom he had issue Henry Percy (called Hotspur) slain at
the battle of Shrewsbury; Thomas Percy, the second son; Ralph
Percy, the third son; and Alan Percy, the fourth son, who died
young.&nbsp; The earl&rsquo;s second wife was Maud, daughter of
Thomas Lord Lucy, by whom he had not any issue.&nbsp; Henry Percy
(Hotspur) left issue, by his wife Elizabeth, oldest daughter of
Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, a son Henry, afterwards second
Earl of Northumberland, who in the third year of Henry V. was
restored to his honours; a staunch supporter of the Lancastrian
party, and was slain at the first battle of St. Albans, on the
22nd of May, 1455; <a name="citation2c"></a><a href="#footnote2c"

class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; When I visited the church in May
1856, I was very sorry to hear that a subscription had been
entered into, for the purpose of what was termed
&ldquo;renovating&rdquo; this curious and interesting
edifice.&nbsp; As far as respects removing the modern pillars,
and the plastered ceiling from the chancel, and making the latter
appear more in accordance with its ancient state, few persons
would object to that measure; but it ought to be borne in mind
that the chancel will accommodate, and much more than
accommodate, the whole number of church-goers of the very scanty
population of Battlefield parish; and that the renovation or
rebuilding of any other part is wholly unnecessary, with
reference to the spiritual requirements of the
parishioners.&nbsp; It would evince great want of taste and
judgment to renovate or restore the ancient nave and tower.&nbsp;
The remains are most valuable to the historian and
arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; The interval was so very short,
comparatively speaking, between the erection of the church in the
reign of Henry IV., and the seizure of the edifice and its
contiguous college and hospital in the reign of Henry VIII., that
we cannot doubt that the remains are now an authentic and
interesting example of church architecture of the reign of the
former monarch.&nbsp; The parties who wish for or recommend the
renovation of the nave, or the restoration of the whole of
Battlefield Church, may possibly find some architect, who, like
an old-clothes man, may undertake to &ldquo;renovate&rdquo; the
article which he is accustomed to deal in, or, in other words, to
make it &ldquo;as good as new&rdquo;; but when the alterations in
this church are finished, they may probably furnish an example of
a lamentable destruction of a very ancient, curious, and
historical relic of times gone by.&nbsp; As a proof of the
mischief which may be done by so-called restorations, let any
person of good taste, who has paid even moderate attention to
arch&aelig;ology and church architecture, look around, and say
whether, out of the numerous ancient churches which have been
attempted to be restored or renovated, during the last quarter of
a century, there can be found more than some five or six, where
bad taste or presumption has not been evinced in the attempts of
the various architects to restore or renovate them.&nbsp; If this
tasteless system is allowed to proceed, we may, ere long, hear of
some ignorant architect who may offer to rebuild or beautify
Tintern Abbey, or restore or renovate Kenilworth Castle.</p>

Richard Plantagenet (called of Coningsburg) Earl of Cambridge,
and Anne his wife, daughter of Roger Mortimer Earl of March and
Lord of Wigmore and Clare, the son of Edmund Mortimer, third Earl
of March, &amp;c. by Philippe, only daughter and heiress of
Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son of King Edward the
Third.&nbsp; Besides which, the Duke of York was descended from
Edward III. by his father&rsquo;s side, in consequence of being
the only son of Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was the son of
Edmund (of Langley) Duke of York and Earl of Cambridge, fifth son
of Edward III., by Isabel, the daughter of Peter, King of Castile
and Leon.&nbsp; The Duke of York married Cecily, daughter of
Ralph Neville, first Earl of Westmoreland, by Joan his second
wife, daughter of John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster.&nbsp; By that
marriage he became related to or connected with most of the great
noblemen of England.&nbsp; His wife had for brothers, Richard
Neville Earl of Salisbury (father of Richard Neville Earl of
Warwick, called the King Maker), William Neville Lord Falconberg,
George Neville Lord Latimer, Edward Neville Lord Abergavenny, and
Robert Neville Bishop of Durham; and for half brothers, Ralph
Neville Earl of Westmoreland, and &mdash; Neville Lord of Ousley
or Oversley, in Warwickshire, in right of Mary his wife.&nbsp;
The Duke of York&rsquo;s power, with the additional aid of that
of his wife&rsquo;s relations, soon enabled him to bring forward
his claims to the throne; and although he was cut off by death in
battle, before he could compass his views, his son Edward
succeeded in obtaining the crown.&nbsp; The Duke left by his
wife, eight sons and four daughters.&nbsp; The sons
were&mdash;first, Henry, who died young; second, Edward Earl of
March, born at Rouen on the 29th of April, 1441, afterwards King
Edward IV.; third, Edmund Earl of Rutland, murdered after the
battle of Wakefield in 1460, by Lord Clifford; fourth, William,
born at Fotheringay, in Northamptonshire; fifth, John, born at
Fotheringay; both of the two last died when infants; sixth,
George Duke of Clarence, born in the Castle of Dublin, put to
death in the Tower of London on the 18th of February,
1477&ndash;8; seventh, Thomas, who died in his infancy; eighth,
Richard, born at Fotheringay, 2nd of October, 1452, afterwards
King Richard III., slain at the battle of Bosworth in 1485.&nbsp;
The daughters were&mdash;first, Anne, married to Henry Holland
Duke of Exeter, but, being divorced from him in 1472, she then
married Sir Thomas St. Ledger, by whom she had issue, Anne,
married to George Manners Lord Roos, by whom she had Thomas
Manners Earl of Rutland; second, Elizabeth, married to John de la
Pole Duke of Suffolk; third, Margaret, married in 1468 to Charles
Duke of Burgundy, called the Bold, or the Rash; and Ursula, of
whom nothing is said by historical writers, and it is, therefore,
presumed that she died young.</p>
<p>The Duke of York was the first nobleman in the kingdom, in
point of family and power.&nbsp; His claim to the throne of
England was grounded on his descent from Lionel, third son of
King Edward III.&nbsp; Lionel&rsquo;s first wife was Elizabeth,
daughter and heiress of William de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, in
Ireland, in whose right, he (Lionel) was created Earl of Ulster;
and because he had with her the honour of Clare, in the county of
Suffolk, as parcel of the inheritance of her grandmother
(Elizabeth, coheir of the last Gilbert de Clare, Earl of
Gloucester and Hertford), he was in 1362, created Duke of
Clarence, <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> from which duchy the name of
Clarencieux King of Arms, of the south parts of England, is
derived.&nbsp; He had issue by Elizabeth his wife, one only
daughter, Philippe, before mentioned, who married Edmund
Mortimer, third Earl of March, grandfather of Anne Countess of
Cambridge, who was the mother of Richard Duke of York, and
grandmother of King Edward IV. and of King Richard III.</p>
<p>The Duke of York enjoyed vast possessions in England and
Ireland, in right not only of his paternal line of the houses of
York and Cambridge, but also of his descent from the great and
powerful families of Mortimer (Earls of March), Clare (Earls of
Gloucester and of Hertford), and de Burgh (Earls of
Ulster).&nbsp; He was closely allied to the great and noble
family of Neville, from having married Cecily, daughter of Ralph
Neville Earl of Westmoreland, besides being connected with
several other noble and powerful families.</p>

also <i>ibid.</i> p. 369, in which it is stated, that Queen
Margaret and Edward Prince of Wales had been at Chester, and
afterwards at Eccleshall, previously to the battle; and that Lord
Stanley was directed, before it took place, to come with his
forces, and join the Lancastrians; and that he sent his servant
to the Queen and the Prince with a promise to do so in all haste,
but failed, and by his failing to join them, the Lancastrians
were defeated, although he was, with 2000 men, within six miles
of Blore Heath, and that he staid three days at Newcastle, only
six miles from Eccleshall, where the Queen and Prince of Wales
then were; and that in the morning after the defeat of the
Lancastrians, Lord Stanley sent a letter to the Queen and Prince,
extenuating his not having assisted them with his forces; and
that he then departed home again; and also that the people and
tenants of the King and of the Prince, in the hundreds of Wirral
and of Macclesfield, had been prevented by Lord Stanley from
going to the assistance of the King; and he was also accused of
having, on the night ensuing the battle, sent a letter of
congratulation to the Earl of Salisbury.&nbsp; If those charges
were true, it looks very much as if he had been a Yorkist at
heart, but disposed to keep fair with both sides.</p>

summoned to Parliament as Lord Stanley, on the 20th of January,
1455&ndash;6, in the 34th of Henry VI., and died in the 37th year
of that King&rsquo;s reign, 1459; he married Joan, the daughter
of Sir Robert Goushill, of Hoveringham, in the county of

was succeeded by his oldest son Thomas (afterwards first Earl of

realm, on the 24th of May, 1461, in the first year of Edward IV.,
by the title of Baron Stanley of Latham.&nbsp; (Dugdale&rsquo;s
<i>Baronage</i>, vol. iii. p. 248; Collins&rsquo;s
<i>Peerage</i>, vol. iii. p. 41, 42; and the <i>Memoirs of the

of the family having been summoned to Parliament amongst the
barons of the realm, or having been ennobled, prior to Thomas
Lord Stanley, afterwards first Earl of Derby.&nbsp; Edmundson, in
his <i>Peerage</i>, states that the latter was summoned to
Parliament as Lord Stanley, in 1456; but it should seem that he
means the father of the latter.&nbsp; It is certain that the
father had a title as Lord Stanley, some time during the reign of
Henry VI., from the passage in the act of the Parliament of
Coventry, 38th Henry VI. (1459): &ldquo;William Stanley Squier
sonne to Thomas late Lord Stanley;&rdquo; and from &ldquo;Lord
Stanley&rdquo; being also repeatedly mentioned, in the
proceedings of that Parliament (38th Henry VI.), and William
Stanley being there called the brother of Lord Stanley; which it
is impossible to apply to any other Lord Stanley, except Thomas
Lord Stanley, afterwards first Earl of Derby, who was his
brother, and who was also the son of the late Lord
Stanley.&mdash;<i>Rot. Parl.</i> 38 Henry VI. (1459), vol. v. pp.
348, 369, 370.&nbsp; See also <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 39 Henry VI.
(1460), vol. v. p. 382; in which the Lord Stanley then living
(who was afterwards first Earl of Derby), is called &ldquo;Thomas
Stanley, Lord Stanley;&rdquo; and his deceased father is
particularly designated as &ldquo;Thomas Stanley, late Lord
Stanley his Fader;&rdquo; besides which, the deceased is more
than once called &ldquo;Thomas, late Lord Stanley.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thomas Lord Stanley, by his defection and opportunely going over,
with his forces, at the battle of Bosworth, to the Earl of
Richmond, was of the utmost service to him, and was the principal
cause of his gaining the victory and the crown, was for so doing,
created first Earl of Derby of that name, by Henry VII., in 1485,
and died in 1504.&nbsp; Sir William Stanley (brother of the
last-mentioned Lord Stanley) also commanded a considerable body
of troops, at that battle.&nbsp; The aid of Sir William Stanley
against Richard III. on that occasion, contributed very greatly,
to place Henry upon the throne of England; yet Henry, forgetful
of benefits received, caused Sir William Stanley to be beheaded
on Tower Hill, on the 16th of February, 1494&mdash;5, on a very
questionable charge, not of any treasonable actions, but of some
alleged disloyal words.&nbsp; He was of Holt Castle, in the
county of Denbigh, where he had large landed possessions, besides
great quantities of plate, money, jewels, and other personal
property; and the forfeiture of his wealth, is generally supposed
to have been no slight motive, in inducing that avaricious and
tyrannical King, to put him to death.&nbsp; When he fought at the
battle of Blore Heath, there was exhibited a melancholy and
revolting but very common effect of civil war; relatives fighting
against each other; for his brothers-in-law, Sir William
Troutbeck, who had married Margaret, the oldest sister, and Sir
Richard Molyneux of Sefton, who had married Elizabeth, the second
sister of Sir William Stanley, were both slain in that
battle.</p>

it 28 years, and that it had previously been for a long period in

upon the field of the battle of Blore Heath, but that he did not
know at what date it had been discovered.&nbsp; He also informed
me, that some pieces of armour had been formerly found in a pit
near to, but not upon, the field of battle.</p>
<p>The blade of the sword is 2 feet 10&frac34; inches long, and
close to the hilt, it is about 1&#8539; inch wide.&nbsp; The
blade is fluted on both sides, and with one edge, to within 11
inches of the point, and from thence it has two edges, as if it
had been calculated for thrusting and not for cutting.&nbsp; The
pommel is ornamented with a ribbed sloping pattern, and the guard
is also ornamented, and is 4&frac12; inches in length.&nbsp; The
whole is of steel or iron.&nbsp; The hilt is 5&frac12; inches
long, and 3 inches in circumference; and there is a substance
resembling the hard shell-like skin or covering of some kind of
fish remaining round the gripe of the hilt.&nbsp; The whole of
the sword is tolerably perfect, except that for some inches from
the point it is injured by rust.</p>
<p>I cannot possibly doubt the veracity of those who spoke to me
respecting it, but they may have been misinformed as to its
history.&nbsp; It certainly may have been found at Blore Heath,

travelling in that vicinity, whether they are arch&aelig;ologists
or not; and, thanks to the liberality and kindness of the noble
owner, strangers are allowed access to the walks and views,
without any other restriction, than some trivial ones, with
respect to the mode of enjoying themselves, such as taking
refreshments or convivial practices, which are generally
considered objectionable, and are much better avoided in a

Southwick, in Hampshire, on the 22nd of April, 1445, and was
crowned at Westminster on the 30th of May following.&nbsp; On the
13th of October, 1453, Edward, the only child of the marriage,
was born.&nbsp; After the defeat of the Lancastrians at the
battle of Tewkesbury, and his murder, on the 4th of May, 1471,
Margaret fled, and took sanctuary in a poor religious house, and
was brought from thence prisoner to London, and Henry died in the
Tower very soon after the battle.&nbsp; A considerable time
afterwards she was sent home to her father, Duke Ren&egrave;,
having been ransomed by Louis XI. King of France for 50,000
crowns; and nothing more, connected with England, occurred
respecting her, during the remainder of her life, which was
passed in retirement, and she died in France, in 1482.</p>

was fought is not a hill, although the ground has a gradual
ascent from the river and Delapr&eacute; Abbey, up to the cross,

class="footnote">[48d]</a>&nbsp; The descent of the Duke of
Buckingham from King Edward III. was as follows:&mdash;Humphrey
de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, a nobleman of immense possessions,
had two daughters, his coheiresses.&nbsp; Eleanor, the eldest
daughter, married Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, sixth
son of King Edward III.&nbsp; Thomas Duke of Gloucester had by
her, amongst other issue, a daughter Anne, whose first husband
Edmund Stafford, fifth Earl of Stafford, was slain at the battle
of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; They had a son, Humphrey, first Duke of
Buckingham, who married Anne, daughter of Ralph Neville, first
Earl of Westmoreland, and was slain at the battle of
Northampton.&nbsp; Their eldest son was Humphrey Earl of
Stafford, who married Margaret, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, Duke
of Somerset, and was slain at the first battle of Saint
Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Their son Henry Stafford, second Duke of
Buckingham, married Katherine, daughter of Richard Wideville or
Wodeville, Earl of Rivers, and was executed in the first year of
Richard III.&nbsp; Besides the descent of Henry Stafford, second
Duke of Buckingham, from Edward III., as above mentioned, he was
also descended from him, through his (the Duke of
Buckingham&rsquo;s) mother, Margaret Beaufort, from John
Beaufort, Earl of Somerset (son of John of Gaunt, Duke of
Lancaster, fourth son of Edward III.), by Katherine Swinford, but
born before their marriage, in which defect of a legitimate
title, by his maternal descent, his case resembled that of King
Henry VII.&nbsp; The Duke of Buckingham, however, from one or
both of those sources of descent, probably flattered himself with
the hope of one day being King of England; and it has been very
reasonably suggested, that it was fortunate for the Earl of
Richmond, afterwards King Henry VII., that his first expedition
and attempt to land in England, was a total failure, and
terminated in the execution of the Duke of Buckingham; for if
that powerful and ambitious nobleman had succeeded in deposing
Richard III., it is very probable that he would have attempted to
have seized the throne, in his own right.</p>
<p>Mary, the second daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of
Hereford, married Henry Earl of Derby, afterwards King Henry IV.;
and it should be here observed, that the Duke of Buckingham was
entitled, by descent from Eleanor, eldest daughter of the Earl of
Hereford, to at least half of his great possessions.&nbsp; After
the line of Henry IV. had become extinct, the other half was
vested in Edward IV. and his heirs; but Buckingham considered
himself entitled to it, as heir at law of Mary, the second
daughter of the Earl of Hereford.&nbsp; Shakespeare seldom wrote
without a meaning, and from what is above stated, his object in
the drama of <i>Richard III.</i> will be at once apparent, in
causing the Duke of Gloucester to offer the following inducement
to the Duke of Buckingham to support his claim to the
throne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And look when I am King, claim thou of
me<br />
The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables<br />
Whereof the King, my brother, was possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakespeare&rsquo;s</span> <i>King Richard
III.</i>, act iii. scene 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems probable that in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time the word
&ldquo;moveables&rdquo; was not used in the same sense in which
we now use it, for at present that word would be considered
strangely inapplicable to lands, castles, manors, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="footnote49"></a><a href="#citation49"
class="footnote">[49]</a>&nbsp; Historians have not always
agreed, respecting the place where the Duke of Buckingham was
executed: some have stated that the execution took place at
Salisbury, and others at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It is certain that he
was captured in Shropshire.&nbsp; The most authentic of the old
historical writers, however, state, and apparently upon good
grounds, that he was sent a prisoner to Salisbury, where Richard
III. then was; and that he was beheaded upon a new scaffold in
the open market-place of Salisbury, on the 2nd of November,
1483.&mdash;See Fabyan Hall, Holinshed, Grafton, Speed, and
Stow.</p>
<p>It is well worthy of notice, that in the year 1838, an
interesting discovery took place at Salisbury.&nbsp; Under a
brick floor, about eight inches below the surface, at the
Saracen&rsquo;s Head Inn, in that city, during some repairs then
in progress, the remains of a man were discovered interred there;
but the skull and the bones of the right arm were not with the
rest of the skeleton.&nbsp; The bones had belonged to a man who
appeared to have been decapitated, and were supposed to have been
those of the Duke of Buckingham.&mdash;See the Liverpool
<i>Courier</i> of the 12th of September, 1838, in which the above
particulars appear copied from the Salopian <i>Journal</i>.&nbsp;
There is nothing surprising in the fact of the bones of the arm,
as well as the skull, being wanting, because formerly the
different members and quarters, as well as the heads of persons
executed, were not unfrequently severed from the bodies, and
fixed up in conspicuous places.&nbsp; That was done even as
recently as in the time of the wicked Judge Jeffreys, after the
suppression of the Duke of Monmouth&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp; In
the case of the Duke of Buckingham, it was very probable, as he
was beheaded in 1483 for high treason, in taking arms and making
war against the King, that the duke&rsquo;s right arm would also
be fixed up wherever his head was placed.</p>

&ldquo;Sir John Courtney,&rdquo; were attainted for having been
engaged at the battle of Towton.</p>
<p>But the account given by Sandford in his <i>Genealogical
History</i>, page 313, differs in some respects from it.&nbsp; He
states that Thomas Courtenay, seventh Earl of Devon, married
Margaret, second daughter of John Earl of Somerset, and, siding
with King Henry VI. against the Yorkists, was by King Edward IV.
taken prisoner at the battle of Towton, and beheaded at York, the
3rd of April (<i>an.</i> 1 Edward IV.), in the year 1461; and
that their children were, Thomas Earl of Devon, made prisoner at
the same battle, and being attainted in a Parliament at
Westminster, the 4th of November, <i>an.</i> 1 Edward IV., soon
after lost his head; that Henry Courtenay, the second son, had
his head cut off in the same quarrel at Salisbury; and that John
Courtenay, the third son, fell in the battle of Tewkesbury.&nbsp;
Dugdale, in his <i>Baronage</i>, vol. i. p. 641, however, states,
that Thomas Earl of Devonshire was, for being at the battle of
Towton with his father, attainted by the act of 1st Edward IV.,
but did not suffer death, as it seems, for it appears that he was
slain at the battle of Tewkesbury, fighting on behalf of Henry
VI., and there buried.&nbsp; Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i>,
vol. vi. fo. 93 [p. 82], also states that Thomas Earl of
Devonshire was slain at Tewkesbury, and buried there.&nbsp; It is
stated in Banks&rsquo; <i>Dormant and Extinct Baronage</i>, vol.
iii, p. 249, that Thomas Earl of Devon, a firm Lancastrian, died
just before the accession of Edward IV. to the throne, and had by
his wife Margaret, daughter of John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset,
five daughters and three sons: Thomas, his successor; Henry,
beheaded for his attachment to the House of Lancaster; and John,
slain on the same side, at the battle of Tewkesbury.&nbsp; Is it
not probable, that the personage who fought at Tewkesbury, called
the Earl of Devonshire, was only the nominal earl of that title,
and that he was the same person who, as Sir John Courteney,
fought at Towton, and was attainted in the 1st of Edward IV., and
who was afterwards called by the Lancastrians, the Earl of
Devonshire?</p>

and heir of James, fourth Earl of Ormond, was created Earl of
Wiltshire in the 27th of Henry VI.&nbsp; In the 30th of Henry
VI., by the death of his father, he also became Earl of
Ormond.&nbsp; He was a staunch Lancastrian, and fought for that
party at the first battle of St. Alban&rsquo;s, in 1455; also at
the battle of Wakefield, and again at the battle of
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross.&nbsp; He appears also to have been at the
battle of Towton.&nbsp; (See Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Baronage</i>,
vol. iii. p. 235.)&nbsp; After that battle he was captured by the
Yorkists, and was beheaded upon the 1st of May, 1461, at
Newcastle.&nbsp; It is very remarkable, that although historians
state that he fought on the Lancastrian side at the battle of
Wakefield, and although he was attainted by the act 1st Edward
IV. (1461), his name is not included amongst those of the
noblemen and others, who were attainted for taking a part in the
battle of Wakefield.&nbsp; His attainder was, ostensibly at
least, for a different offence; viz., for inducing the enemies of
the King to enter the realm, and make war against him. <a

Wiltshire having fought at the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross,
is mentioned not only by the old historians, but also in <i>Rot.

the act, as the reason for his attainder.&nbsp; It does not seem
easy to understand how he could be engaged at the battle of

fighting at Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross.&nbsp; See, however,

with some forces, and greatly injured the castle and roofs, and
took away the lead to his house at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, which he
was building at considerable cost; and Belvoir Castle remained in
a state of ruin, and uninhabitable, until the Earl of Rutland [in

seems that Edmund afterwards got privately into England, and

Little more seems to be known of him, except that he was not
within the realm in the first year of Henry VII., when he
petitioned for, and obtained, an act of Parliament for the
reversal of the attainder, and he died at Enfield in the year

paper upon the extraordinary and abrupt changes of fortune of
Jasper Earl of Pembroke, afterwards Duke of Bedford, in the
fifteenth century, written by the author of this work, and read
by him in person, on the 31st of March, 1856, before a meeting of
the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, for which
the thanks of the meeting were voted to him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, often
called Jasper of Hatfield, from the place of his birth, was a
nobleman celebrated for his descent, and for the royal and
illustrious alliances of his family.&nbsp; He was one of the
noble personages who lived and distinguished himself in the
fifteenth century: a period memorable in the history of England,
for foreign and domestic wars, and civil dissensions, and for the
strange mutations of fortune, which its princes and nobles were
doomed to experience; and perhaps we may search the pages of
history, in fruitless endeavours to discover an instance of any
nobleman, who experienced such abrupt and extraordinary
vicissitudes, and such sudden and astonishing transitions, on
several occasions, from power and wealth, to exile and poverty,
and again from the miseries of a poor outlaw and fugitive, to
rank, possessions, and honours, as fell to the lot of Jasper Earl
of Pembroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters now little to us, whether in the wars of
York and Lancaster, and the violence and exasperation of the
contending factions, the one party or the other was in the right;
but under every possible circumstance, whether the cause which he
espoused was successful or unfortunate, he uniformly supported
the Lancastrian interest; and when we consider how many
personages of high rank fought during those lamentable conflicts,
sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, and joined the
winning party, as seemed best to suit their own interests, we
must at least give him credit for consistency, and perhaps for
sincerity.&nbsp; One reason of some moment, may, however, be
found for his strenuous and consistent support of the Lancastrian
party.&nbsp; He was half-brother of King Henry VI., being the son
of Sir Owen Tudor, who was descended from persons of the first
consideration, and of a family of great antiquity in Wales, by
his wife Queen Katherine, daughter of Charles VI. King of France,
and widow of Henry V. King of England, and had by Queen
Katherine, two sons, the oldest of whom was Edmund Earl of
Richmond, usually denominated Edmund of Hadham, who married
Margaret, daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, son of
John Earl of Somerset, a son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,
fourth son of Edward III., by whom he had a son, Henry Earl of
Richmond, who was afterwards King Henry VII.; and the second son
of Sir Owen Tudor was Jasper Tutor, who was, in consequence of
his father&rsquo;s marriage with Queen Katherine, uncle of King
Henry VII.&nbsp; King Henry VI. created Jasper Tudor, Earl of
Pembroke; and in consequence of his recovering the castle of
Denbigh, and other strongholds in Wales, out of the hands of the
adversaries of Henry, he obtained a grant of 1000 marks, payable
out of the lordships of Denbigh and Radnor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Earl of Pembroke appeared in 1460&ndash;1, in arms,
with James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire, and a considerable army, as
supporters of Henry VI.; and on the 2nd of February, in that
year, fought at the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, against the
Yorkists, under the command of Edward Earl of March, afterwards
King Edward IV.; but the Lancastrian army was completely
defeated, and the two earls were compelled to escape by
flight.&nbsp; It may be fairly presumed, that he was not present
at the battle of Towton in 1461, as he was not included in the
list of those persons who were attainted by the act of Parliament
of 1st Edward IV. (1461), <i>Rot. Parl.</i> vol. v. fo. 477, for
taking a part in that battle; yet he seems nevertheless to have
been exerting himself in arms for Henry VI. about that time,
because in a subsequent part of the same act of Parliament, he
was attainted for having with others, as alleged, at different
times since the 4th of March in that year, incited the enemies of
King Edward IV. to enter the realm and to commence hostilities
against him; and also for having made war against the King
&lsquo;at a place called Tutehill, besid&rsquo; the Toune of
Carnarvan, in Wales, on Friday next after the Fest of Translacion
of Seint Edward last past, rered werre ayenst the same our
Soverayne Lord, purposying then and there to have proceeded to
his destruction, of fals and cruell violence ayenst their feith
and Liegeaunce.&rsquo;&nbsp; From that passage it can scarcely be
doubted, that an engagement between some forces of the hostile
factions, took place near Carnarvon, in 1461, but I am not aware
that any historian has handed down to us, any account of it, or
even noticed it: an additional proof, if any were wanting, that
much more bloodshed and misery were experienced in this country,
during the Wars of the Roses, than our old annalists and
chroniclers have recorded.&nbsp; The Earl of Pembroke lost his
rank, his possessions, and, in a word, his all, by the attainder,
for all that he had was confiscated.&nbsp; His earldom was
conferred upon William Herbert of Ragland; and Jasper Tudor
became an outlaw and a fugitive, and, as is very forcibly
expressed by Baker, in his <i>Chronicles</i>, &lsquo;The Earl of
Pembroke went from country to country, little better than a
vagabond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again the scene suddenly changed.&nbsp; In 1470,
William Herbert, the rival Earl of Pembroke, was captured by the
Lancastrians at the battle of Edgecott, in Northamptonshire
(usually called the battle of Banbury, from its contiguity to
that town), and was beheaded.&nbsp; Jasper Tudor, who still
claimed the title of Earl of Pembroke, landed in the west with
George Duke of Clarence (who then sided with the Earl of Warwick
in the Lancastrian interest), and King Edward was driven from his
throne and kingdom by the Earl of Warwick.&nbsp; Jasper Tudor was
shortly afterwards restored to his rank and title, and a second
time became Earl of Pembroke, resumed his possessions in Wales;
and finding his nephew, Henry Earl of Richmond, then scarcely ten
years of age, in the care of the widow of his deceased rival,
William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, he removed him from her
superintendence, took him and presented him to Henry VI., who, on
seeing him, is said (with what truth may well be doubted) to have
made a speech almost prophetic of Richmond&rsquo;s future
fortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another sudden and startling change occurred in this
strange and wonderful drama.&nbsp; Edward IV. returned to England
in 1471, and obtained a decisive victory over the Earl of
Warwick, at Barnet.&nbsp; Queen Margaret landed at Weymouth; the
Lancastrians once more took up arms, and Pembroke proceeded to
raise forces in Pembrokeshire, with the intention of succouring
her.&nbsp; The disastrous battle of Tewkesbury, and the
consequent utter ruin of the Lancastrian party, compelled him to
retire to Chepstow, and to disband his forces.&nbsp; He then had
a very narrow escape with his life.&nbsp; Edward IV. sent Roger
Vaughan, a valiant person, to surprise Pembroke there; but he
captured Vaughan, beheaded him, and proceeded from thence to the
town of Pembroke.&nbsp; Still he was in imminent danger.&nbsp;
Morgan ap Thomas pursued him, and commenced the siege of that
town; but David ap Thomas, who was the brother of Morgan ap
Thomas, although of the opposite party, came to his assistance,
and succeeded in raising the siege, and Pembroke got from thence
in eight days, and sailed with his nephew, the young Earl of
Richmond, from Tenby, intending to proceed to France.&nbsp; His
ill fortune still prevailed: the winds drove them upon the coast
of Brittany; they were forced to put into a port of that country,
and could not be well excused from paying their respects to the
Duke of Brittany; but when they would have taken their departure,
they were given to understand, that they were not at liberty to
proceed.&nbsp; The Duke of Brittany considering, that these two
noblemen might be of some advantage to him, assigned to them the
town of Vannes for their residence.&nbsp; They were outwardly
treated with all respect due to their birth and rank, but were
narrowly watched.&nbsp; Pembroke&rsquo;s exile was a protracted
one, and he remained abroad, an outlaw, a fugitive, and in
poverty, during several years, most of which he passed in
Brittany, but a short time was spent in France, just before his
return to England as after mentioned.&nbsp; His earldom was
conferred by Edward IV. upon his son, Prince Edward, and was
afterwards held by Richard III.&nbsp; At length, in consequence
of the death of Edward, the odium and unpopularity in which
Richard was held by many, and the English nation being at last
weary of civil war, violence, and bloodshed, the prospect was
opened, of his return to England, and of the accession to the
throne of his nephew, Henry Earl of Richmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In October, 1483, an attempt was made, to effect a
hostile landing in England, by the Earl of Richmond, with some
forces, which were intended to have been supported by the rising
of Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, and others.&nbsp; That
expedition was an utter and disastrous failure.&nbsp;
Richmond&rsquo;s fleet was dispersed by a storm; and although the
ship in which he sailed appeared off Poole, in Dorsetshire, he
found it dangerous, as well as useless, to attempt to land, and
was compelled to return to Brittany.&nbsp; The insurrection was
suppressed, the duke was executed, and Jasper Tudor, with the
bitterness of disappointed hopes, was doomed for some time
longer, to remain in banishment.&nbsp; The old historians do not
expressly mention his having been with Richmond, in that
expedition; but it seems quite impossible, to doubt the fact, of
his having accompanied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more the scene changed in this most strange and
eventful drama.&nbsp; In 1485, the Earl of Richmond, with Jasper
Tudor and some few troops from France, landed at Milford, in
South Wales, and having been joined by their friends and
supporters, the battle of Bosworth (at which the latter had a
principal command) placed Richmond on the throne of England, by
the title of Henry VII.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that event Jasper Tudor found himself for the third
time, Earl of Pembroke.&nbsp; He was restored to his honours and
possessions, created Duke of Bedford, made one of the Privy
Council, and one of the Commissioners for executing the office of
High Steward of England, on the occasion of the ceremony of the
coronation of Henry; also Justice of South Wales, and Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland; and had besides considerable and valuable
possessions, lands, and offices, conferred upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1487, he was joint general, with John De Vere, Earl
of Oxford, at the battle of Stoke, where the Earl of Lincoln was
defeated.&nbsp; He was afterwards again appointed joint general
with the Earl of Oxford, of the army sent into Flanders, in aid
of the Emperor Maximilian, against the French.&nbsp; He married
Katharine, sixth daughter of Richard Widevile or Wodevile, Earl
of Rivers, sister of Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV., and widow of

to the field of battle, on the 24th of May, 1856, I witnessed
there a rare and very beautiful natural phenomenon; a species of
rainbow, of remarkable grandeur, appeared, not as an arch in the
sky, as is usual, but forming a splendid and broad border to the
horizon, and encircling and appearing to rest with its under edge
upon the earth, towards the north, and to touch with its upper
edge a canopy of clouds, the darkness of which formed a striking
contrast, which set off its brilliant prismatic colours to great
advantage.&nbsp; Its beauty and singularity strikingly brought to
my mind, the remarkable phenomenon, seen by Edward, on the same
spot, so many years before.</p>

service, because in the mist, the star with rays, the device of
the Earl of Oxford, who was fighting on the side of Lancaster,
was mistaken for that of Edward, the sun in splendour; and the
Lancastrian archers, deceived by the resemblance, shot at the
followers of the Earl of Oxford, and the mistake contributed
considerably to the loss of the battle by the Lancastrians.</p>

1849, 1850, 1851, 1853, 1854, 1855, and 1856.&nbsp; In one of
those visits (on the 2nd of August, 1853) I walked with my son,
Mr. Alexander Brooke, entirely across the field of battle,
commencing on the ground occupied by the left wing of the
Lancastrians, along the whole line, to the spot occupied by their
right wing; and we descended from thence through the meadows to
the river Cock.&nbsp; Any antiquary inclined to pursue the same
walk, should leave the Ferrybridge road, between Dintingdale and
Towton, and enter the fields at the spot, where he may observe
one of them of very large size, nearly opposite a white farmhouse
standing on the eastward side of the Ferrybridge road.&nbsp; He
may easily procure a countryman, for a small gratuity, to act as
guide to him, if he has doubts about getting well over one or two
fences, which, however, really do not present much
difficulty.&nbsp; The Lancastrians evidently had selected the
highest ground, commanding an extensive prospect, with the
depression or valley after mentioned, in front of a considerable
portion of their line.&nbsp; It was clearly the strongest
position near Towton.</p>

to close quarters, the archers would be withdrawn to the

Sprott&rsquo;s <i>Fragment</i>, printed by Hearne, that the
battle commenced at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
continued all night, and terminated on the following afternoon,
which is quoted in Turner&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>, vol.

of an anonymous writer, is not entitled to any weight, when put
into the scale, against the accounts given by the old historians,
respecting the commencement and termination of the battle.&nbsp;
Mr. Turner has even improved upon the statement, and says that
the armies fought by the light of fire and torches.&nbsp; Armies
in those days did not usually fight by torch or fire light.&nbsp;
When did any old historical writer mention such an event
occurring in any of the wars of the English, of that
century?&nbsp; The statement seems to be completely erroneous;
and the mistake has perhaps arisen from confounding the
engagement which took place at Dintingdale, on the 28th of March
(and possibly at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon), with the
great battle on the 29th of March.&nbsp; It is, however, not
unlikely, that each army endeavoured to harass the other, by
frequent discharges of cannon, during the night before the
battle.&nbsp; As some proof of the probability of such an
occurrence, we are expressly told in Holinshed&rsquo;s
<i>Chronicles</i>, p. 684, that during the night before the
battle of Barnet, the Lancastrians continually discharged cannons
at the camp of Edward IV., and by Leland (see 1 Lel. <i>Coll.</i>

son of Sir Leonard Hastings, Knight, by Alice his wife, daughter
of Lord Camois, and was a valiant and active partisan of the
House of York, distinguished himself at the battle of Towton, and
on other occasions, and was created Baron Hastings, Lord
Chamberlain of the Household, and Chamberlain of Wales, in the
first year of Edward IV., and had large possessions bestowed upon
him by that king; amongst which was a grant of the manor of
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in Leicestershire, which had lately belonged
to James Earl of Wiltshire, then attainted, (where Hastings
subsequently either erected or restored the castle there, for his
own residence, pursuant to the King&rsquo;s license, of first
Edward IV., to make several castles), also of the honour, castle,
and lordship of Belvior, and other possessions in Leicestershire,
and elsewhere.&nbsp; He adhered to Edward IV. in his adversity,
when he was compelled, by the Earl of Warwick, to fly to the
Continent in 1470, and accompanied him on his return to
England.&nbsp; He also fought at the battle of Barnet in 1471,
where he had the command of 3000 horse, and at that of
Tewkesbury, where he was one of the principal commanders.&nbsp;
He was Lieutenant of Calais, and enjoyed several offices of great
importance and trust, and was greatly in the confidence of King
Edward IV.; and it is generally believed that his faithful
attachment to the young princes, the sons of that king, was the
reason why Richard Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard
III., caused him to be put to death.&nbsp; He was beheaded on a
log of wood, in the Tower of London, without any trial, on the
13th of June, 1483, and is buried in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel,
Windsor, near the grave of Edward IV.&nbsp; He married Catherine,
daughter of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury (beheaded after
the battle of Wakefield, in 1460), and widow of William Lord
Bonvile (put to death after the second battle of St.
Alban&rsquo;s, on 17th February, 1460&ndash;1), by whom he left
issue three sons and a daughter.</p>

ennobled his brothers the Duke of Clarence and Duke of
Gloucester; but Leland appears to have expressed himself either
not clearly, or not with his usual accuracy, with respect to the
dates of the conferring of the titles upon several of the other
personages, before mentioned, as may be easily ascertained by a
reference to the works of Ralph Brooke, or Dugdale; from which it
plainly appears, that although Edward did not forget eventually
to reward many of his supporters and adherents with rank and
titles, yet in some instances several years elapsed, after his
coronation, before they were ennobled, or, as the case might be,
were advanced in the peerage.&rdquo;</p>

dislodged the body of Yorkists under Lord Fitzwalter&rsquo;s

class="footnote">[114b]</a>&nbsp; In a note to Rapin&rsquo;s
<i>History of England</i>, translated by Tindal, it is stated,
with reference to the engagement at Ferrybridge, &ldquo;there was
at this time no Lord Fitzwalter, for Walter Lord Fitzwalter died
in 1432, and Sir John Ratcliffe, son of Ann, daughter of the said
Lord Fitzwalter, had not summons to Parliament till the first of
Henry VII.&nbsp; This Sir John, or his son, is probably the same
whom Rapin, and other of our historians, call by anticipation
Lord Fitzwalter.&nbsp; See Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Baronage</i>, vol.
i. p. 223, and vol. ii. p. 285.&rdquo;&nbsp; But although it may
readily be admitted, that it does not appear from our Baronages,
that there was a Lord Fitzwalter in 1461, their silence seems
scarcely sufficient to outweigh the clear and unqualified
statements, of several of our old annalists and chroniclers, that
a Lord Fitzwalter held a command of importance in the Yorkist
army, and was slain in the action at Ferrybridge.&nbsp; Stow not
only mentions that circumstance, but also states that Lord
Fitzwalter was one of the noblemen who, on the 12th of March
(before the battle of Towton), left London with Edward, and
accompanied him on his march northward.&nbsp; Besides which, in
Leland&rsquo;s <i>Itinerary</i>, vol. i. fo. 105 [99] (see also
Camden&rsquo;s <i>Magna Britannia</i>, vol. iii. p. 49), in
noticing Ferrybridge, it is stated, &ldquo;wher the first Lord
Fitzgualter of the Radecliffes was killid, flying from Cok beck
Felde;&rdquo; and, although the last part of the passage is not
quite accurate, still the statement is of some value; and in
Fenn&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Original Letters</i>, which are
considered authentic records of the respective dates, at which
they purport to have been written, Lord Fitzwalter is mentioned,
in a letter from Clement Paston to John Paston, of the 23rd of
January, 1460 (but, according to our present mode of reckoning,
1461), as having ridden northwards, and is said to have taken two
hundred of Sir Andrew Trollop&rsquo;s men; and the existence of a
Lord Fitzwalter seems still more confirmed by another of those
letters, which was written by William Paston and Thomas Playter,
to John Paston, dated the 4th of April, 1461, giving the contents
of a letter of credence from King Edward IV. to the Duchess of
York, respecting the battle of Towton, which distinctly mentions
that Lord Fitzwalter was slain, and that he had been engaged on
Edward&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; (See Fenn&rsquo;s <i>Collection of
Original Letters</i>, vol. i. pp. 205, 219.)&nbsp; As so many old
writers have mentioned the existence of a Lord Fitzwalter at that
period, it seems improbable that all of them could have been in
error.</p>

also held a principal command in the Yorkist forces, was also
slain there.&nbsp; Some historians tell us that the Earl of

Ferrybridge.&nbsp; It is an improbable tale.&nbsp; We may perhaps
safely admit, that he, as a warrior, knew the value of a good
horse too well to destroy it wantonly and uselessly.</p>

at Dintingdale.</p>

argent as one of the devices of the House of York, in consequence
of its having been borne by the Mortimers, Earls of March, from
whom he was descended; also the Dragon sejant sable, armed or, in
consequence of his descent from the De Burghs, Earls of Ulster,
whose cognizance was a Dragon; the falcon argent within a
fetter-lock closed; the White Rose; the Sun in its glory, after
the parhelion had been seen at the battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s
Cross; and (occasionally) the White Hart attired, accolled with a
coronet, and chained or, on a mount vert, in honour of King
Richard II., who used it, and who had nominated Roger Mortimer,
Earl of March, great-grandfather of Edward IV., his successor to
the crown of England.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark, that besides
the circumstance of Edward IV. having had the Black Bull on his
standard at the battle of Towton, his brother, Richard III.,
seems to have had, at the battle of Bosworth, on one of his
standards, the Dun Cow (perhaps in allusion to the family
tradition of the Earls of Warwick, with which family he was
connected through Anne his wife, the daughter of Richard Neville,
the great Earl of Warwick).&nbsp; See Holinshed, Hall, and Baker,
who mention that Henry VII., after the battle of Bosworth,
offered at St. Paul&rsquo;s three standards, described as
follows: viz., first, the figure of St. George; second, a Red
Dragon, on white and green sarcenet; third, a Dun Cow upon yellow
tartan.&nbsp; Hutton, in his <i>Bosworth Field</i>, p. 147,
states, without giving his authority, that Henry VII., on his
arrival in London, carried in front Richard III.&rsquo;s three
standards, the chief of which was St. George, and erected them in
St. Paul&rsquo;s Church; and also on p. 110, that
Richmond&rsquo;s (afterwards Henry VII.) standard at the battle
of Bosworth, was a Red Dragon, upon green and white silk; and we
know from other sources, that the Dragon Rouge was a favourite
device of Henry VII.&nbsp; It seems, therefore, tolerably
certain, that of the before-mentioned three standards, the
second, or Red Dragon, was that of Henry VII., and we may
reasonably conclude, that the other two were those captured from
Richard III.</p>

Duke of Clarence was put to death in 1477&ndash;78, in the Tower
of London.&nbsp; He was interred at Tewkesbury.&nbsp; See
Stow&rsquo;s <i>Annals</i>, p. 431; the <i>Catalogue of
Nobility</i>, &amp;c. by Ralph Brooke, p. 52; Additions to
Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i>, by Gough, edition of 1789, vol.
i. p. 269; Sandford, p. 413; Rapin, vol. i. (in Notis, p.
624).&nbsp; Those accounts appear to be corroborated by the
circumstance, that the Duke&rsquo;s wife Isabel was interred in a
stone arched vault, near the high altar, in the Abbey Church
there.&nbsp; Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, vol. vi. fo. 92 [p.
81], states that she died at the Castle of Warwick, on the 22nd
of December, 1476, and was buried at Tewkesbury, of which she was
the patroness.&nbsp; The entrance to the vault is covered by a
large blue stone, under which is a flight of eight steps, which
lead to the vault, which was opened and examined in 1826, on the
occasion of some repairs, when the skulls and some bones of a man
and a woman were discovered in it; besides which there were also
six large stones at the south end of it, which apparently had
been placed there, in order to support two coffins abreast; which
adds not a little to the supposition that he was buried in the
same tomb with the Duchess.&nbsp; Sandford expressly states that
the Duke was buried at Tewkesbury, near the body of his
Duchess.&nbsp; It was evident that the vault had been long
previously entered, probably at the time of the dissolution of
abbeys, or of the parliamentarian wars, and rifled of every thing
worth taking away.&nbsp; The floor of the vault was paved; and
extending nearly the length and breadth of it, was the
representation of a cross, formed by the insertion of bricks,
some of which contained the arms of England, of the Clares,
&amp;c.; and others contained representations of
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, birds, ornamented letters, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Under the belief that the mortal remains so discovered, were
those of the ill-fated Duke of Clarence, and of Isabel his wife,
the skulls and bones were collected, placed in an ancient stone
coffin, and the vault again closed up.&nbsp; It furnishes us with
an impressive moral, and appears like an awful and just
retribution, that so soon after the Duke had assisted in, or at
least countenanced, the murder of Prince Edward, after the battle
of Tewkesbury, his own death by violence, by the tyrannical
orders of his brother, Edward IV., should have occurred, and his
corpse should have been deposited in the Abbey Church, within
sight of which the murder was committed.</p>
<p><a name="footnote144"></a><a href="#citation144"
class="footnote">[144]</a>&nbsp; Fabyan says, that it was the
King&rsquo;s servants who committed the murder.&nbsp; If, as
seems improbable, he means domestic servants, it does not make
any difference in the crime, whether the noblemen present
committed the murder with their own hands, or sanctioned its
commission by domestics.</p>
<p><a name="footnote145a"></a><a href="#citation145a"
class="footnote">[145a]</a>&nbsp; It is said that human bones
were found there; but it is unfortunate that no full and detailed
account seems to have been preserved of the examination of the
grave, or what kind of human bones, whether male or female, old
or young, were discovered, for they might have done much to throw
light upon the subject.&nbsp; I could not obtain any further
information relative to it, from the person who showed me through
the Abbey Church.&nbsp; The practice of interring corpses in
stone coffins continued a considerable time after the date of the
battle of Tewkesbury.&nbsp; The corpse of Richard III. was
interred, after the battle of Bosworth, in 1485, in a stone
coffin, in the Grey Friars Church at Leicester.&nbsp; His remains
were, at the time of the destruction of religious houses,
disturbed, and the stone coffin was converted into a
watering-trough, at the White Horse Inn, in Gallow Tree Gate, and
was so used until it was broken to pieces.&mdash;Hutton&rsquo;s
<i>Battle of Bosworth</i>, pp. 142, 143.&nbsp; See also

in his <i>History of Tewkesbury</i>, suggests, that
Margaret&rsquo;s encampment was at a place adjoining the town and
abbey, called the Vineyard.&nbsp; Little as we may truly think of
the Duke of Somerset&rsquo;s talents as a military commander, he
could scarcely have made so ridiculous a mistake, as to have
fixed upon so low and insecure a spot, as the Vineyard, commanded
by the high ground of Holme Hill, and with the little river the
Swilgate not in his front, but in his rear.&nbsp; What Mr. Dyde
has mistaken for intrenchments, are nothing more than some
trifling inequalities in a spot of ground close to the abbey,
which in all probability, was formerly used as a garden or
vineyard, as its name implies.</p>

Chap. II.)&nbsp; There is a very remarkable peculiarity connected
with Lord Stanley&rsquo;s (and the same observation applies in
some degree also to Sir William Stanley&rsquo;s) defection from
Richard, and with his joining the Earl of Richmond, which has
never been explained, as far as I am aware, by any author.&nbsp;
Richard thought that he could secure Lord Stanley in his
interest, by conferring benefits upon him, and made him Constable
of England for life, with an annuity of &pound;100 a year payable
out of the revenue of the county of Lancaster, and created him a
Knight of the Garter.&nbsp; The reasons usually assigned by
historians for Lord Stanley&rsquo;s defection are, his attachment
to the memory of Edward IV., and his being faithful to the young
King Edward V.; the attempt believed to have been made by Richard
to cause him to be destroyed at the council (when Lord Hastings
was seized and beheaded) in 1483; and his being then committed to
prison for a time by Richard&mdash;all which are said to have
rankled in his mind; besides the influence which his wife
exercised over him in favour of the Earl of Richmond, Lord
Stanley having married to his second wife the Countess of
Richmond, the mother of the earl.&nbsp; The date of Lord
Stanley&rsquo;s marriage with the Countess of Richmond does not
appear to be stated in the Baronages, but it certainly occurred
at least ten years before the reign of Richard III., because the
Countess of Richmond is mentioned as being the wife of Lord
Stanley in <i>Rot. Parl.</i> 13th Edward IV. (1473) vol. vi. fo.
77.&nbsp; No plan for an insurrection could be better arranged
than that of the Duke of Buckingham in the first year of Richard
III. (1483), yet nothing could have worse success.&nbsp; But if
Lord Stanley and his brother had brought forward their power, and
had taken an active part in it, the probability is, that Richard
would at that time have been dethroned.&nbsp; Neither Lord
Stanley nor Sir William Stanley, however, appears to have taken
the slightest step, or to have been in any shape concerned in
that insurrection; yet precisely the same reasons which are
assigned for Lord Stanley&rsquo;s defection from Richard at the
battle of Bosworth, in 1485, appear equally to apply to influence
him in 1483, when the Duke of Buckingham took up arms.&nbsp; It
is very difficult to account for Lord Stanley&rsquo;s then
remaining quiescent, unless we may infer that there was a feeling
of jealousy in his mind, and that he suspected that as the Duke
of Buckingham was a more powerful nobleman than himself and was
of the blood royal of England (see Chap. III. pp. 48, 49, note
4), it was possible that he might, if successful, claim the crown
in his own right; or that Lord Stanley did not consider that the
feeling of the noblemen and gentry against Richard, was then
sufficiently ripe or decided for an insurrection; or that he was
watching events, with the purpose of adhering at last to the
strongest.</p>
<p><a name="footnote168a"></a><a href="#citation168a"

should seem that he advanced from his right centre, because the

the new buildings near Bow Bridge, with an inscription treating
the locality as if it were the supposed place of the final
interment of Richard III.; but although it may perhaps be a
disappointment to those who have caused the tablet to be placed
there, to learn that the correctness of their theory is not
admitted by others, still it is only proper to mention, that
there does not appear to be any authority for such a supposition:
indeed, after his remains had been pulled out of the grave and
got rid of at the river, it is not likely that anybody would know
or care what became of them.</p>

year of Henry&rsquo;s reign (1485); but it might perhaps have
perplexed Henry to have asked him at what exact date the first

are very ably rebutted by those writers; and that what he terms
the coronation roll of King Richard III., in which are items for
robes, &amp;c. for King Edward V. (from which he would infer,
that the latter monarch was alive, and even present at the
coronation of the former), is only a wardrobe account of Piers
Curteys, the king&rsquo;s wardrober, kept from the time of the
death of Edward IV., of which the deliveries for the expected
coronation, of course, form a considerable part; but that the
robes, &amp;c., alluded to were prepared for the use of Edward
V., at his own intended coronation, and not at that of his uncle,
who took effectual measures, that, notwithstanding Piers
Curteys&rsquo;s arrangements, they should never be used for the
purpose which he contemplated.&nbsp; That idea receives a strong
confirmation from Sir Thomas More, who, in his <i>History of the

<p>An interesting proof of the use of cannon and other engines by
the French during the siege of a fortress in the fourteenth
century, is given in the <i>Rotuli Parliamentorum</i> of the 1st

Edward III. (&ldquo;jadys Roy d&rsquo;Engl.&rsquo; aiel

given at length, it is stated, that he had not sufficient forces

<p>There is not any evidence of the period when the invention of
gunpowder took place; but the general opinion of antiquaries
appears to be, that it was a discovery of very remote antiquity;
that its use may be dated back centuries before its first
application to the purposes of war; and that for a very long
period of time after its invention, it was merely used (more
particularly in Asia) for recreative fireworks, and brilliant
spectacles.&nbsp; Whilst on the subject of fireworks, it may be
advisable to mention here, that they were in common use in Europe
in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; Fireworks are mentioned by Philip
de Commines, <a name="citation216c"></a><a href="#footnote216c"
class="citation">[216c]</a> as having been thrown for amusement
into the air, and afterwards running flaming on the ground, at
Estampes, after the battle of Montl&rsquo;hery, in 1465.&nbsp; We
also learn from the same authority, an instance in 1494, of
fireworks having been exhibited at Venice, from the steeples of
the city, and pieces of artillery having been discharged. <a

guns during very many years after the battle of Crescy, and the
want of skill in the art of gunnery, as well as the silence of
the English and French historians, seem almost conclusive against
the use of them at that battle, although the contrary has been
asserted.</p>
<p>There is an interesting and valuable paper, which was written
by the Rev. Joseph Hunter, F.S.A., and published in the
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, vol. xxxii. p. 379, which contains many
proofs of the use of gunpowder and cannons in the time of Edward
III.; but, although it must be admitted that the evidence which
he adduces is quite sufficient to show that they were then in use
for the purpose of besieging towns and fortresses, he does not
bring forward any proofs, or even any strong reason, for our
supposing that they were ever used in the open field, during the
reign of Edward III.</p>

that the &ldquo;bastons &agrave; feu,&rdquo; the nature of which,
is not clear, adverted to by Monstrelet, as with the convoy
brought up by the English, in besieging Orleans in 1428, were
some kind of portable firearms.&nbsp; He several times uses that
expression, particularly in describing the wars of the
Burgundians and French.&nbsp; It ought, however, to be mentioned
here, that with reference to the attack by the Burgundians upon
Paris, in 1460, he uses the expression, &ldquo;canons
serpentines, et autres bastons de pouldre et a feu, avec trait de
bastons inuasibles a main.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the early part and
middle of the fifteenth century, if gun-carriages were
occasionally used, they certainly were not always adopted; and
when cannons had to be transported from place to place, they were
frequently conveyed in carts or waggons; and we learn from the
ancient historical writers, that at that period, for want of
carts and waggons, the besiegers were occasionally obliged, on
raising a siege, to abandon their cannons.</p>

coulevrines,&rdquo; by which, as has been correctly observed by
Mr. Grose, it is impossible that he could have meant 10,000 of
such unwieldly engines as cannons; he evidently meant hand-guns
or firearms, sufficiently light to be portable.&nbsp; It is also
certain that firearms (haquebuts or harquebusses), so small as to
be used on horseback (the origin of the modern carbine and
pistol), were used on the Continent, in the year 1495; because on
the retreat of the French after the battle of Fernova, in Italy,
fought in that year, the rear of their army was defended by 300
Germans, many of whom had &ldquo;coulevrines,&rdquo; and others
on horseback were armed with

wars in France, in the reign of Henry VI., and especially on the
12th of February, 1429, when having the command of a body of men,
convoying provisions and supplies for the English, who were
engaged in the siege of Orleans, he was attacked on his march
thither, near Rovray St. Denis, by a much superior body of French
and Scotch: but he obtained the victory, and succeeded in
delivering the convoy in safety to the besiegers.&nbsp; He died

similarity in the names, Sir John Fastolf, who lived in the time
of Henry VI., must not, however, be confounded with the
fictitious character so admirably drawn by Shakespeare, the Sir
John Falstaff, represented by him as living in the time of Henry
IV., and dying in the reign of Henry V.&nbsp; As far as I can
discover, there is not any old historian who mentions such a
person as the imaginary Sir John Falstaff, or any person of a
name similar to the latter, living at that period, whose habits
and associates resemble those of the amusing character described

the daughter of Sir Richard Saltingstall, Knt., the Lord Major,

Sir Peter was gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I., for
twelve years ambassador at Constantinople, and afterwards
comptroller of the household, and a privy councillor.&nbsp; He
died in 1643, leaving two sons and a daughter, of whom the elder
son, Sir Peter Wyche, was envoy to the court of Muscovy, in
1669.&nbsp; The younger, Sir Cyrill Wyche, Knt. (named after his
godfather, the Patriarch of Constantinople), established the
Norfolk branch of the family, sat for many years in Parliament,
was secretary to the lieutenancy in Ireland, and one of the lords
justices there.&nbsp; The second Sir Peter Wyche had four sons,
of whom John was envoy extraordinary at Hamburgh; Barnard, from
whom a branch of the family in Leicestershire descended, and
Peter and George, died unmarried.&nbsp; Sir Cyrill Wyche, the son
of John, was appointed by Queen Anne to be resident at Hamburgh,
when only nineteen years of age; and in the reign of George I.,
he was minister and envoy extraordinary to the circle of Lower
Saxony, also envoy extraordinary to the court of Russia; and was
created a Baronet whilst at the Hans Towns, December 20th, 1729,
but dying without surviving male issue, in 1756, the baronetcy

have been the day of the battle; and in Baker&rsquo;s

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
